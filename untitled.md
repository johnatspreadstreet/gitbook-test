| **1. INTRODUCTION** |
| :--- |


**This RIA Procedures Manual is specifically tailored to Tavco Financial Advisory, Inc. \(the  “Firm”\) and its investment advisory activities. These procedures establish a system of  supervision and controls reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable  securities laws, rules, and regulations. These procedures will govern the supervision of  the Firm’s investment advisory business until such time as they are amended.** 

**1.1 Terms and Abbreviations** 

**The following terms, abbreviations, and phrases may be used throughout these  procedures:** 

**• “TFA,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “the Firm” means Tavco Financial Advisory, Inc., a  registered investment adviser.** 

**• “Advisory Representative” refers to an individual registered with the Firm as an  investment adviser representative. An individual who performs investment  advisory functions but is exempt from registration as an investment adviser  representative is also considered an Advisory Representative.** 

**• “RIA” or “registered investment adviser” refers to a legal entity registered as an  investment adviser.**  

**• “investment adviser” is an abbreviated form of “registered investment adviser.”  To avoid confusion, these procedures will use the term “investment adviser” to  refer only to a legal entity, and not to individuals who are investment adviser  representatives.** 

**• “CCO” is an abbreviation for Chief Compliance Officer and refers to Thomas J.  Tavenner or any other individual authorized to act on his behalf. The CCO is  ultimately responsible for the Firm’s compliance program and has the authority  to delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to other qualified individuals.** 

**• “Compliance Department” refers to the department of the Firm responsible for  compliance with all laws, rule, and regulations applicable to its business as a  registered investment adviser. The Compliance Department is headed by the  CCO.** 

**• “Designated Principal” refers to a supervisor or qualified designee who has been  made responsible for performing a function described in these procedures. The  use of Designated Principal to refer to an individual does not imply that the  individual needs to be registered as a securities principal.**

**Page 1 January 24, 2019** 

**• “employee” refers to any individual performing operational, compliance,  supervisory, or other functions in relation to the Firm’s investment advisory  business. Advisory Representatives are considered employees, even if they are  treated as independent contractors for tax purposes.** 

**• “Supervised Person” refers to a partner, officer, director \(or other person  occupying a similar status or performing similar functions\), or employee of the  Firm, as well as any other person who provides advice on behalf of the Firm and  is subject to the supervision and control of the Firm. Advisory Representatives  and employees are Supervised Persons of the Firm.** 

**• “Access Person” refers to any individual associated with the Firm who has access  to information related to the trading practices or securities holdings of clients.  All Advisory Representatives are Access Persons. Employees and Supervised  Persons who are not Advisory Representatives may be deemed Access Persons  depending on the functions they perform for the Firm.** 

**1.2 Duty to Review and Comply with Procedures** 

**All Advisory Representatives and Supervised Persons of the Firm have the duty to make  certain that all laws, regulations, rules, and policies applicable to the Firm’s business are  observed in the office\(s\) where they are employed, which consequently obligates such  persons to be familiar with and to remain current concerning the Firm’s policies and  procedures. Each Advisory Representative must fully comprehend and be thoroughly  familiar with these procedures before conducting any business on behalf of the Firm.** 

**1.3 Updates and Amendments** 

**This RIA Procedures Manual will be periodically updated and amended as needed based  on material changes or amendments to corresponding rules. The Firm may deliver  updates to its Supervised Persons electronically in the form of replacement pages or  sections. Paper copies of all compliance policies and procedures are available upon  request. Advisory Representatives are responsible for reviewing all updates and  amendments immediately upon receipt.** 

**1.4 Memoranda and Notices** 

**The Firm may periodically deliver a memorandum or similar notice to Supervised  Persons in an effort to provide clarification or guidance concerning the Firm’s policies  and procedures. Supervised Persons are expected to read each memorandum and  adhere to any mandate contained therein. Each memorandum is considered a part of** 

**Page 2 January 24, 2019** 

**the Firm’s written supervisory procedures. Consequently, failure to follow instructions  contained in a memorandum will be deemed a violation of the Firm’s procedures.** 

**1.5 Enforcement of Procedures** 

**Failure to follow the Firm’s policies and procedures may result in internal disciplinary  action, which may include fines, suspensions, and/or termination. The Firm reserves the  right to reflect any violation of its policies and procedures on a supervised person’s  Form U-5. The Firm, through its CCO, is committed to implementing and enforcing these  procedures.**  

**1.6 Exceptions to the Procedures** 

**From time to time, situations may arise where it is appropriate to deviate from the  procedures found in this manual. For example, an exception may be warranted when  strict adherence to the procedures in this manual would be to the detriment of the  client and a deviation from the procedures would actually benefit the client. Deviations  from required procedures will be permitted only with the approval of the CCO.  Approvals will be documented, along with information concerning the rationale for the  deviation. In no case will an approval except or excuse any Supervised Persons from  compliance with any law, rule, or regulatory requirement.** 

**1.7 Confidential Nature of Procedures** 

**This Procedures Manual must be treated as a confidential internal document. This  Procedures Manual belongs to the Firm and should be returned to the Firm by  Supervised Persons in the event of their termination of employment.** 

**1.8 Questions and Feedback** 

**Because this Procedures Manual cannot possibly cover every detail of the Firm’s  investment advisory business, Supervised Persons are required to consult with the  Compliance Department if they have a question about something not covered in the  written procedures. The Firm values the feedback of its Supervised Persons and  encourages them to notify the Compliance Department not only if they have questions  but also if they have suggestions for improving the Firm’s written policies and  procedures.** 

**1.9 Compliance with State and SEC Rules** 

**The Firm is not currently registered with the SEC but makes every effort to comply with  the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to SEC-registered investment advisers. Since** 

**Page 3 January 24, 2019** 

**state laws, rules, and regulations largely mirror those that are applicable to SEC registered investment advisers, this Procedures Manual will frequently reference SEC  rules that would govern an aspect of the Firm’s business if the Firm had registered with  the SEC rather than various states. Supervised Persons are expected to comply with the  SEC rules cited in this manual as if the Firm were registered with the SEC. If there is a  material deviation or conflict between an SEC rule and the corresponding state rule such  that the Firm must give precedence to complying with the state rule, the Firm will give  Supervised Persons specific instruction on how to comply with the state rule.**  

| **2. DUTIES OF THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND  SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL** |
| :--- |


**2.1 Designation of Chief Compliance Officer** 

**Under SEC Rule 206\(4\)-7, every investment adviser must designate a chief compliance  officer to administer its compliance policies and procedures. The chief compliance  officer should be competent and knowledgeable regarding federal securities laws and  should be empowered with full responsibility and authority to develop and enforce  appropriate policies and procedures. The chief compliance officer must have full  responsibility for all compliance personnel as well as overall responsibility for the  investment adviser’s compliance program. Thus, the chief compliance officer must be  vested with sufficient seniority and authority within the organization to implement and  enforce compliance policies and procedures.**  

**The Firm has designated Thomas J. Tavenner as its CCO. Mr. Tavenner is qualified to  serve as the Firm’s CCO and has the available resources to carry out his duties as CCO.  This determination was reached based on multiple factors, including, but not limited to,  the following:** 

**• Mr. Tavenner’s qualifications shown by the passing of the Series 65, Uniform  Investment Adviser Law Examination, which demonstrates that he is highly  knowledgeable about investment adviser rules and regulations and is well  qualified to assess and monitor the activities of the Firm;** 

**• His depth and breadth of experience gained from working for many years in the  securities industry;** 

**• The Firm’s utilization of securities attorneys, compliance consultants, and other  professionals to advise him and the Firm on complex compliance matters;**

**Page 4 January 24, 2019** 

**• The Firm’s use of an email archiving service, which facilitates the review of email  correspondence;** 

**• The Firm’s relatively small size and business focus of referring clients to third party money managers, which gives the CCO ample time to closely supervise the  Firm’s personnel and monitor clients’ accounts;** 

**• His commitment to high ethical standard, as set forth in the Firm’s code of  ethics; and** 

**• The Firm’s utilization of compliance consultants to vet policies and procedures  established by the CCO and to assist in the periodic review of policies and  procedures.** 

**Mr. Tavenner will ensure that he remains qualified to serve as CCO by monitoring  changes in the regulatory, legal, and business environment and becoming conversant  with those changes that affect the Firm’s business. Moreover, Mr. Tavenner will ensure  that any constraints on his time do not compromise the performance of his duties as  CCO.** 

**2.2 Duties of the Chief Compliance Officer** 

**The CCO is responsible for ensuring adequate supervision over the activities of all  persons who act on the Firm’s behalf. The CCO’s specific duties include, but are not  limited to, the following:** 

**• Establishing procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent and detect  violations of the law by the Firm’s advisory personnel;** 

**• Analyzing the Firm’s operations and creating a system of controls to ensure  compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations;** 

**• Ensuring that all advisory personnel fully understand the Firm's policies and  procedures;**  

**• Establishing an adequate review system designed to provide reasonable  assurance that the Firm's policies and procedures are effective and being  followed; and** 

**• Ensuring that each Designated Principal has reasonably discharged his  supervisory responsibilities in accordance with the procedures.**

**Page 5 January 24, 2019** 

**2.3 Annual Review of Compliance Policies and  Procedures** 

**The CCO must review, at least once annually, the adequacy of the established  compliance policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation. The  review should consider, at a minimum, the following:** 

**• Any compliance matters that arose during the previous year;** 

**• Any changes in the business activities of the Firm or its affiliates; and** 

**• Any changes in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or applicable regulations  that might suggest a need to revise the policies or procedures.** 

**Although this review is required annually, the CCO may choose to perform components  of it throughout the year in an effort to minimize the burden on the Firm’s compliance  personnel and resources.**  

**2.4 Supervisory Systems** 

**The Firm will establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of its Advisory  Representatives and Supervised Persons. At a minimum, the Firm’s internal supervisory  system will require the Firm to:** 

**• Establish and maintain written procedures;** 

**• Designate one or more qualified persons to supervise the Firm’s investment  advisory business;** 

**• Assign each Supervised Person to a qualified supervisor who is responsible for  supervising the Supervised Person’s activities;** 

**• Make reasonable efforts to ensure that each person with supervisory  responsibility is qualified through experience or training to carry out such  supervisory duties; and** 

**• Designate and specifically identify each supervisor who will review the Firm’s  supervisory systems, procedures, and internal inspections.** 

**2.5 General Responsibilities of Supervisory Personnel** 

**The Firm regards supervision as a critical focus area for remaining compliant in its  investment advisory business activities and operations. The Designated Principals  responsible for the supervision of others must diligently supervise the activities and  individuals under their immediate supervision. The Firm has created and will maintain** 

**Page 6 January 24, 2019** 

**an internal supervisory structure that details the role and responsibilities of each  Designated Principal.** 

**2.5.1 Delegation of Responsibilities** 

**If a Designated Principal is unable to perform certain supervisory or approval  obligations, he may delegate such supervisory responsibilities to another person so long  as the person is qualified and appropriately registered. Upon delegation, the Designated  Principal should ensure that each person understands the assigned responsibility. The  Designated Principal must then review and assess the performance of each person  assigned a responsibility. Formal delegations of responsibilities will be documented in  writing and include the names, tasks, and dates of delegation. Examples of functions  that may be delegated to qualified individuals include, but are not limited to, the  following:** 

**• Preparing and updating written policies and procedures on behalf of the Firm; • Conducting compliance training for new and existing employees; • Performing risk assessments;** 

**• Drafting procedures to document the monitoring and testing of compliance through internal audits; and** 

**• Implementing any policies needed to ensure that training and internal  assessment procedures are updated to reflect changes in applicable laws and  regulations.** 

**2.5.2 Roles of the Designated Principal** 

**The Designated Principal serves many critical roles at the Firm, the most important of  which are described below:** 

**• The Designated Principal sets standards for Advisory Representatives and other  Supervised Persons who participate in the Firm’s investment advisory business.** 

**• The Designated Principal inspires Advisory Representatives to adhere to the  Firm's internal standards as they work toward achieving their individual goals  and the Firm’s business objectives.** 

**• The Designated Principal serves a teaching role with respect to the Firm’s  investment advisory activities.** 

**2.6 Supervision of Sub-Advisers** 

**The Designated Principal will be responsible for monitoring the third party advisers to  whom the Firm refers clients. The Firm’s supervisory obligations with respect to a** 

**Page 7 January 24, 2019** 

**particular third party adviser depend on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement  between the third party adviser and the Firm. The Firm will consider the following areas  when assessing the degree to which it must supervise a third party adviser:** 

**• Contractual Obligations – At a minimum, the Firm must supervise the third party  adviser in accordance with the provisions and contractual obligations found in  the agreement between the third party adviser and the Firm. The written  representations found in the Firm’s advisory agreements with clients and in the  Firm’s written disclosure documents may create other contractual obligations to  supervise third party advisers.**  

**• Implied Obligations – In cases where the agreement with the third party adviser  does not fully set forth the supervisory responsibilities of the Firm, the  Designated Principal will carefully evaluate the arrangement with the aim of  identifying any supervisory obligations that are not expressly stated in the  agreement but are implied by the nature of the arrangement.**  

**• Fiduciary Duty – In addition to considering the express and implied supervisory  obligations, the Designated Principal should identify any supervisory obligations  that emanate from the Firm’s fiduciary duty to manage client affairs with  prudence and due care.** 

**• Business Expectations – The Designated Principal will consider the need to  supervise a third party adviser in a manner that goes beyond the Firm’s legal  duty. This additional level of supervision, if warranted, should be designed to  monitor how well the third party adviser is meeting the business expectations of  the Firm.** 

**2.6.1 Guidelines for Conducting Due Diligence of Third Party  Advisers** 

**Before entering into an agreement with a third party adviser, the Firm will perform due  diligence of the third party adviser. The degree of due diligence performed by the Firm  may vary based on the perceived risk of the third party adviser. In performing due  diligence, the Designated Principal may ask for copies of, or get a written explanation of,  the following items related to the third party adviser:** 

**• Basic Firm Information – Brief history, structure, size, lines of business,  registrations, personnel turnover, etc.** 

**• Compliance System – Is the third party adviser’s compliance system  computerized or manual? How frequently are reviews performed? Who is the  chief compliance officer and what is his or her background? How often does the**

**• Internal Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines – The third party adviser’s policies  and procedures concerning proxy voting, best execution, brokerage allocation,  soft dollars, directed brokerage, valuation, trade error, and any other area that  would affect the third party adviser’s relationship with the Firm and its accounts.** 

**• Other Policies and Procedures – Is the third party adviser also affiliated with a  broker-dealer or bank that is subject to other procedures that could affect the  relationship?** 

**• Code of Ethics** 

**• Insider Trading Policy** 

**• Form ADV \(including Part 2A\) – All disclosure documents should be reviewed.**

**• Copies of Regulatory Correspondence – All correspondence for the last five  years with the SEC or other regulatory authorities pertaining to compliance  inspections or examinations \(including deficiency letters and responses\),  compliance matters, and any actual, potential, or alleged regulatory violations.** 

**• Summary of Material Legal Threats – Inquiries, investigations, or actions  \(including private, administrative, regulatory, or other\) from the last five years  involving alleged third party adviser legal, compliance, regulatory, or other  violations, where the complaining party is the SEC, any other regulatory  authority or self-regulatory organization, a customer or client, a shareholder or  similar beneficiary of an advised account, or another party acting in the interest  of any such parties.** 

**The Designated Principal has the authority to decide which items to review as part of  the Firm’s due diligence of a third party adviser. If the third party adviser objects to  providing any of the items listed above, the Designated Principal should treat it as a red  flag and inquire thoroughly into the nature of the objection. The third party adviser  might have a legitimate concern justifying its objection. If the objection relates to a  matter of confidentiality, the Firm should consider entering into a confidentiality or  nondisclosure agreement with the third party adviser.**

**Page 9 January 24, 2019** 

**2.6.2 Guidelines for the Supervision of Third Party Advisers The Firm’s supervision of a third party adviser could include, among other things, the  following:** 

**1. Periodically requesting and inspecting the items reviewed during the initial due  diligence;** 

**2. Requiring the third party adviser to forward, on an annual basis, a current copy  of its Form ADV Part 2A \(or other disclosure documents\) to the Firm for review.** 

**3. Requiring the third party adviser to provide the Firm with an annual certification  of compliance with the third party adviser’s policies and procedures;** 

**4. Conducting periodic meetings with compliance personnel of the third party  adviser;** 

**5. Requiring the third party adviser to provide notice of regulatory examinations  and copies of any exam reports, as well as a description of how the third party  adviser addressed any compliance deficiencies;**

**• regulatory developments, or** 

**• any other event likely to have a significant effect on the third party adviser’s  operations.** 

**The supervisory activities enumerated above are meant to serve as guidelines for the  Designated Principal. The Firm’s supervision of any particular third party adviser will be  determined by the Designated Principal, who is granted authority to utilize any means of  supervision that is reasonable designed to monitor the third party adviser.** 

**Page 10 January 24, 2019** 

| **3. FIDUCIARY STANDARD** |
| :--- |


**As an investment adviser, the Firm has a fiduciary duty to its clients that requires more  than honesty and good faith alone. The Firm’s fiduciary responsibilities impose on its  Advisory Representatives an affirmative duty to act solely in the best interests of the  clients and to make full and fair disclosure of all material facts, particularly where the  Firm’s interests may conflict with the client’s interests. It means that the Firm has an  affirmative duty of loyalty to its clients. In plain English, the Firm and its Advisory  Representatives must always act in the best interests of each client and deal fairly with  all clients.**  

**3.1 Fiduciary Principles** 

**Both the Firm and its Advisory Representatives are prohibited from engaging in  fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative conduct. In accordance with their affirmative  duty of utmost good faith to act solely in the best interest of the clients, Advisory  Representatives must adhere to the fiduciary principles described below.** 

**3.1.1 Disinterested Advice** 

**The Firm and its Advisory Representatives must provide advice that is in each client’s  best interest. Neither the Firm nor any of its Supervised Persons may place their  interests ahead of any client's interests under any circumstances.**  

**3.1.2 Written Disclosures** 

**The Firm’s written disclosure brochures and its advisory agreement must include  language detailing all material facts regarding the Firm, the advisory services rendered,  compensation, and conflicts of interest. It is the responsibility of the Designated  Principal to establish procedures designed to ensure that the clients are provided with  these documents and that they contain the proper disclosure language.**  

**3.1.3 Oral Disclosures** 

**Where circumstances may require oral disclosures to be provided to a client, the  Designated Principal should determine the proper manner in which to phrase or  otherwise make such disclosures and establish reasonable procedures for monitoring  compliance.**  

**3.1.4 Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest** 

**Advisory Representatives must disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interest when  dealing with clients. For example, if investment advice includes recommendations for  transactions that would be executed through an affiliate of the Firm, then the advice  given would be subject to a potential conflict of interest that needs to be disclosed. The** 

**Page 11 January 24, 2019** 

**Firm does have an affiliated broker-dealer which may create a conflict of interest in  situations where recommendations are made to clients to purchase securities from the  broker-dealer affiliate. The Designated Principal will ensure that actual and potential  conflicts of interest stemming from the Firm’s affiliation with The Tavenner Company,  Inc. are adequately disclosed in the Firm’s written disclosure brochure.**  

**3.1.5 Avoidance of Self-Dealing** 

**An Advisory Representative must avoid conduct that gives the appearance that he has  placed the interests of himself, the Firm, or an affiliate over the interests of a client.**  

**3.1.6 Confidentiality** 

**Client records and financial information must be treated with strict confidentiality.  Under no circumstances should any confidential information be disclosed to any third  party that has not been granted a legal right from the client to receive such information.  To the extent that confidential information about a client is shared with The Tavenner  Company, Inc. or another party, the Designated Principal will ensure that the sharing of  information complies with applicable privacy laws.** 

**3.1.7 Avoidance of Fraud and Deception** 

**Engaging in any fraudulent or deceitful conduct with a client is strictly prohibited.  Examples of fraudulent conduct include, but are not limited to, misrepresentation,  nondisclosure of fees, and misappropriation of client funds. The Firm’s policies and  procedures are tailored to the Firm’s business of referring clients to third party advisers.  Most notably, the Firm mitigates the risk of fraud and prevents the misappropriation of  client assets by not taking custody of client assets.**  

**3.1.8 Following Client Guidelines** 

**Advisory Representatives must manage clients’ accounts in accordance with the  guidelines set by each client. Since the Firm generally refers clients to third party  advisers, Advisory Representatives should take care to match the objectives and**  

**investment strategies and styles of each third party adviser to the goals, objectives, and  risk tolerance of each client. The disclosures in each third party adviser’s disclosure  brochure, and the terms of the investment advisory agreement with each client serve as  the guidelines for the recommendations of third party advisers.**  

**3.1.9 Consistency with Investment Strategies** 

**Advisory Representatives must be conscious of the requirement to review and evaluate  their recommendations of third party advisers so that they will at all times remain  consistent with the strategies and guidelines agreed to with each client. Advisory** 

**Page 12 January 24, 2019** 

**Representatives should not engage in investment strategies or assume risks that are  inconsistent client objectives.** 

**3.1.10 Other Fiduciary Obligations** 

**The Firm and its Advisory Representatives are subject to these additional fiduciary  duties when dealing with clients:**  

**• The duty to have a reasonable, independent basis for investment advice;  • The duty to obtain best execution for the client's securities transactions;**  

**• The duty to ensure that investment advice is consistent with the clients’  objectives; and** 

**• A duty to be loyal to the clients.** 

**3.2 Fiduciary Duties under State Law** 

**Most states have statutes that impose fiduciary obligations on investment advisers  registered under their laws or otherwise doing business in their state. In some cases,  state laws can differ from the SEC's rules. The Designated Principal is responsible for  ensuring compliance with the fiduciary obligations imposed by each state in which the  Firm conducts business.** 

**3.3 Fiduciary Duties under ERISA**  

**Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \(“ERISA”\), a fiduciary is any person  who:**  

**1. exercises discretionary authority or control involving the management or  disposition of plan assets;**  

**2. renders investment advice for a fee; or** 

**3. has any discretionary authority or responsibility for the administration of the  plan.**  

**Where the Firm and its Advisory Representatives act as a fiduciary under ERISA, they must:**  

**1. act solely in the interests of the participants and their beneficiaries;**  

**2. act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent man would use in  the same situation;**  

**3. diversify plan investments in an attempt to reduce the risk of large losses unless  it is clearly prudent not to do so; and**

**Page 13 January 24, 2019** 

**4. act according to the terms of the plan documents, to the extent the documents  are consistent with ERISA.** 

| **4. CODE OF ETHICS** |
| :--- |


**Important: The Firm’s code of ethics is a separate document and attached as an exhibit.  The following policies and procedures set forth the key regulatory requirements that  form the basis for the Firm’s code of ethics. Because the Firm is committed to extremely  high ethical standards, its code of ethics will often contain requirements that are more  stringent than those imposed by SEC Rule 204A-1. Consequently, Supervised Persons  must ensure that they comply with all requirements and standards set forth in the code  of ethics, and not just the requirements imposed by SEC Rule 204A-1.** 

**4.1 SEC Rule 204A-1** 

**SEC Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act requires the Firm to adopt a code of  ethics that sets forth the standard of business conduct that is required of all its  Supervised Persons. The Firm’s code of ethics sets out ideals for ethical conduct  grounded in the fundamental principles of openness, integrity, honesty, and trust. The  code of ethics is designed to effectively convey to Supervised Persons the value the Firm  places on ethical conduct, and it challenges Supervised Persons to live up not only to the  letter of the law but also to the ideals of the organization. All Supervised Persons are  reminded that, in addition to being subject to the policies and procedures set forth in  this manual, they are also subject to the Firm’s code of ethics.** 

**4.2 Definition of Access Person** 

**The specific provisions and reporting requirements of the Firm’s code of ethics are  concerned primarily with those investment activities of the Firm’s Access Persons, as  defined below.**  

**“Access Person” means any general partner, officer, or director of the Firm or  any employee of the Firm who: \(i\) has access to nonpublic information regarding  any client’s purchase or sale of securities, or non-public information regarding  the holdings of any client; or \(ii\) is involved in making securities**  

**recommendations to clients or has access to such recommendations that are  non-public.** 

**So long as the Firm’s primary business is providing investment advice, all of the Firm’s  directors, officers, and partners will be presumed to be Access Persons.**

**Page 14 January 24, 2019** 

**4.3 General Conditions of the Code of Ethics** 

**One goal of the code of ethics is to allow the Firm’s Access Persons to engage in  personal securities transactions while protecting advisory clients, the Firm, and its  Access Persons from conflicts that could result from a violation of securities laws or  from real or apparent conflicts of interests. While it is impossible to define all situations  that might pose such a risk, the code of ethics is designed to address those  circumstances where such risks are likely to arise.** 

**Adherence to the code of ethics and the related restrictions on personal investing is  considered a basic condition of employment for Access Persons. If there is any doubt as  to the propriety of any activity, Access Persons should consult with the CCO. The CCO  may rely upon the advice of legal counsel or outside compliance consultants.** 

**In general, the code of ethics requires all Supervised Persons to:** 

**• Act with integrity, competence, dignity, and in an ethical manner when dealing  with the public, clients, prospects, employers and employees, colleagues in the  investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets;** 

**• Place the interests of clients, the interests of their employer, and the integrity of  the investment profession above their own personal interests;** 

**• Practice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner  that will reflect positively on themselves and the profession;** 

**• Maintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and  improve the competence of other investment professionals;** 

**• Promote the integrity of, and uphold the rules governing, global capital markets;** 

**• Use reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment when  conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking  investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.** 

**4.4 Required Content of the Code of Ethics** 

**The CCO will ensure that the code of ethics contains the following content required by  SEC Rule 204A-1:** 

**1. standards of business conduct required of Supervised Persons;** 

**2. provisions requiring Supervised Persons to comply with applicable federal  securities laws;**  

**3. provisions that require all Access Persons to report certain personal securities  transactions for review on a quarterly basis, and holdings on an annual basis, to  the Firm;**

**Page 15 January 24, 2019** 

**4. provisions requiring Supervised Persons to report any violations of the code of  ethics promptly to the CCO or Designated Principal; and**  

**5. provisions requiring the Firm to provide each Supervised Person with a copy of  the code of ethics and any amendments, and requiring Supervised Persons to  provide the Firm with a written acknowledgment of their receipt of the code of  ethics \(and any amendments\).** 

**The CCO is responsible for approving the code of ethics, ensuring that all required  elements are contained therein, and addressing any conflicts.**  

**4.5 Reportable Securities** 

**It is the responsibility of each Access Person to determine whether a particular  securities transaction being considered for his personal account or any other account in  which he has a beneficial interest is reportable under the code of ethics or is otherwise  prohibited by any applicable laws.** 

**Under SEC Rule 204A-1, all securities are reportable securities, with five exceptions  designed to exclude securities that appear to present little opportunity for the type of  improper trading that the transaction and holding reports are designed to uncover. The  exceptions are as follows:**  

**1. transactions and holdings in direct obligations of the United States government;**  

**2. money market instruments—bankers' acceptances, bank certificates of deposit,  commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and other high quality short-term  debt instruments;**  

**3. shares of money market funds;**  

**4. transactions and holdings in shares of other types of mutual funds, unless the  Firm or a control affiliate acts as the investment adviser or principal underwriter  for the fund; and**  

**5. transactions in units of a unit investment trust if the unit investment trust is  invested exclusively in unaffiliated mutual funds.** 

**Access Persons are required to report all transactions in reportable securities on a  quarterly basis within 30 days of the quarter’s end.** 

**4.6 Applicability of Reporting Requirements** 

**The code of ethics applies to all accounts of an Access Person in which he has a direct or  indirect beneficial interest. These accounts are referred to as personal accounts. It is  important to note that the code of ethics applies to any account maintained by or for:** 

**Page 16 January 24, 2019** 

**• An Access Person's current spouse \(not legally separated or divorced from the  Access Person\) and minor children;** 

**• Any individuals who live in the Access Person's household and over whose  purchases, sales, or other trading activities the Access Person exercises control  or investment discretion;**  

**• Any persons to whom the Access Person provides primary financial support, and  either \(i\) whose financial affairs the Access Person controls or \(ii\) for whom the  Access Person provides discretionary advisory services.**  

**• Any trust or other arrangement which names the Access Person as a beneficiary  and/or the Access Person as trustee. It does not include any account for which  an Access Person serves as trustee of a trust for the benefit of \(i\) a person to  whom the Access Person does not provide primary financial support, or \(ii\) an  independent third party.** 

**• Any partnership, corporation, or other entity of which the Access Person is a  director, officer, or partner or in which the Access Person has a 25% or greater  beneficial interest, or in which the Access Person owns a controlling interest or  exercises effective control.** 

**4.6.1 Personal Accounts of Other Access Persons** 

**A personal account of one Access Person that is managed by a second Access Person is  considered a personal account to the second Access Person only if he has a beneficial  ownership in the personal account. Without beneficial ownership, the account is  considered a client account with respect to the Access Person managing the account.** 

**4.6.2 Solicitors and Consultants** 

**Non-employee solicitors or consultants are not subject to the code of ethics unless the  solicitor or consultant, as part of his duties on behalf of the Firm, \(i\) makes or  participates in the making of investment recommendations for the Firm’s clients, or \(ii\)  obtains information on recommended investments for the Firm’s clients.**  

**4.7 Initial, Annual, and Quarterly Reporting Access Persons must submit the following reports to the Firm:** 

**4.7.1 Initial Holdings Report** 

**Within 10 days of becoming an Access Person, Access Persons are required to provide  the Designated Principal with an initial holdings report that contains, at a minimum, the  following:**

**Page 17 January 24, 2019** 

**1. Disclosure of all of the Access Person’s current securities holdings with the  following content for each reportable security of which the Access Person has  any direct or indirect beneficial ownership:**  

**• title and type of reportable security** 

**• ticker symbol or CUSIP number \(as applicable\)** 

**• number of shares** 

**• principal amount of each reportable security** 

**2. The name of any broker, dealer, or bank with which the Access Person maintains  an account in which he has any direct or indirect interest;** 

**3. The date upon which the report was submitted.** 

**Information contained in the initial holdings reports must be current and dated no more  than 45 days prior to the date of submission. Generally, positions and holdings are  contained within account statements, and delivery of the account statements will  suffice for reporting purposes.** 

**4.7.2 Annual Holdings Report**  

**All Access Persons must also provide annual holdings reports of all current reportable  securities holdings at least once during each 12-month period.** 

**4.7.3 Quarterly Transaction Reports** 

**Access Persons must also provide quarterly securities transaction reports for each  transaction in a reportable security of which the Access Person had, or as a result of the  transaction acquired, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership. Such quarterly  transaction reports must include the following information:** 

**• Date of transaction;** 

**• Title of reportable security;** 

**• Ticker symbol or CUSIP number of reportable security \(as applicable\); • Interest rate or maturity rate \(if applicable\);** 

**• Number of shares;** 

**• Principal amount of reportable security;** 

**• Nature of transaction \(e.g., purchase or sale\);** 

**• Price of reportable security at which the transaction was effected;** 

**• The name of the broker, dealer, or bank through which the transaction was  effected; and**

**Page 18 January 24, 2019** 

**• The date upon which the Access Person submitted the report.** 

**Access Persons must submit a quarterly transaction report no later than 30 days after  the end of each quarter.** 

**4.8 Exceptions from Reporting Requirements** 

**Exceptions from the reporting requirements available under SEC Rule 204A-1 are  described below:**  

**1. No report is required with respect to securities held in any personal account over  which the Access Person has \(or had\) no direct or indirect influence or control;** 

**2. Transaction reports are not required to be submitted with respect to any  transactions effected pursuant to an automatic investment plan \(although  holdings need to be included on initial and annual holdings reports\);** 

**3. Transaction reports are not required if the report would duplicate information  contained in broker trade confirmations or account statements that the Access  Person has already provided to the Firm, provided that such broker trade  confirmations or account statements are provided to the Firm within 30 days of  the end of the applicable calendar quarter. This paragraph has no effect on an  Access Person’s responsibility related to the submission of initial and annual  holdings reports. An Access Person that would like to avail himself of the  exemption should:** 

**• Ensure that the content of broker confirmations or account statements  for any personal accounts meets the content required for quarterly  transaction reports; and** 

**• Inform the Designated Principal that he would like to avail himself of this  compliance option and provide the Designated Principal with the**  

**following for each of his personal accounts: name of institution; address  of institution; name of contact at institution; identification numbers for  personal accounts held at institution; and name of personal accounts  held at institution.** 

**4.9 Pre-Clearance of Transactions in Personal Accounts** 

**4.9.1 Personal Purchases of Securities** 

**Firm personnel must obtain pre-clearance from the CCO to purchase any private  placements or limited offerings of securities, such as an offering of securities exempt  from registration under Rule 506 of Regulation D.**

**Page 19 January 24, 2019** 

**4.10 Amendments to the Code of Ethics** 

**The CCO will periodically review the code of ethics and assess its effectiveness. If the  CCO makes any amendments, he must ensure that the code of ethics remains compliant  with the minimum requirements of SEC Rule 204A-1.**  

| **5. PERSONNEL, LICENSING, AND REGISTRATION** |
| :--- |


**5.1 Firm Registration Requirements** 

**The Firm has registered, and will continue to be registered, as an investment adviser  based upon the fact that it is engaged in the business of managing client assets by  referrals to third party advisers. Section 203A\(a\) of the Investment Adviser Act was  amended to prohibit, with limited exceptions, an investment adviser from registering  with the SEC if the investment adviser has assets under management less than $100  million.**  

**5.1.1 Assets under Management** 

**The Designated Principal will monitor assets under management to ensure that the Firm  remains qualified to maintain its current registration status. When calculating assets for  purposes of determining the proper regulatory authority, the Firm will count assets as  being under its management only if they are in securities portfolios with respect to  which the Firm provides "continuous and regular supervisory or management services."  The following client accounts fall within this category:** 

**• discretionary accounts; and** 

**• non-discretionary accounts in which the Firm has ongoing responsibility to select  or make recommendations, based upon the needs of the client, as to specific  securities or other investments the account may purchase or sell, and, if such**  

**recommendations are accepted by the client, the Firm is responsible for  arranging or effecting the purchase or sale.** 

**The Designated Principal will deem the Firm to not provide "continuous and regular  supervisory or management services" over an account when it:** 

**• provides market timing recommendations \(i.e., to buy or sell\), but has no  ongoing management responsibilities;** 

**• provides only impersonal investment advice \(e.g., market newsletters\);** 

**• makes an initial asset allocation, without continuous and regular monitoring and  reallocation; or**

**Page 20 January 24, 2019** 

**• provides advice on an intermittent or periodic basis, such as upon client request,  in response to a market event, or on a specific date \(e.g., the account is reviewed  and adjusted quarterly\).** 

**5.1.2 Registration and Notice Filing** 

**The Firm will use the IARD system to apply for registration, amend its registration,  withdraw from registration, and transmit notice filings to states in accordance with SEC  and state requirements.**  

**5.2 Registration of Investment Adviser Representatives** 

**Most states require investment advisers to file registration statements for their  investment adviser representatives on Form U-4 through the IARD system. The  Designated Principal is responsible for reviewing the functions of each Supervised  Person to determine whether such Supervised Person meets the definition of  "investment adviser representative." Generally, only those supervised persons who give  advice to individual investors will have to register as an investment adviser  representative with a state.**  

**The Designated Principal will check each state's laws prior to deciding whether a  Supervised Person who is an "investment adviser representative" is required to register  with a particular state and whether exemptions under state law are available. Generally,  each Advisory Representative, absent a state law exemption, must register in:** 

**• the state where he or she is located; and** 

**• the other state\(s\) where he or she meets with clients on a regular basis.** 

**Note: Some states require third party solicitors \(i.e., individuals who solicit advisory  clients for the Firm but who are not employed by the Firm or subject to the Firm's  control\) to register as an "investment adviser representative" if they are in the state or if  they solicit clients in the state, even if they do not have a place of business there and  even if the clients are all entities or wealthy individuals.**  

**5.2.1 Advisory Representative Registration Responsibilities Each Advisory Representative must notify the Designated Principal in a timely manner of  a change in:** 

**• job responsibilities that may affect his or her licensing status or requirements; or** 

**• home address, a married name \(versus a maiden name\), a disciplinary matter, or  any other events that may require an amendment to his Form U-4.** 

**• outside business activities**

**Page 21 January 24, 2019** 

**The Designated Principal will arrange for the filing of the appropriate amendments to  Form U-4 and any other registration documents in response to a change of status for an  Advisory Representative.** 

**5.2.2 Dual Registration** 

**The Firm will not permit dual registration with another investment adviser firm without  the prior written authorization of the Firm’s CCO. All requests for dual registration must  be in writing.**  

**5.2.3 Registration with Other Entities** 

**Supervised Persons must obtain the prior written approval of the CCO before registering  with other entities, including broker-dealers, commodity trading advisors, futures  commission merchants, and insurance companies.**  

**5.3 Employment Procedures** 

**The Firm has established certain policies and procedures regarding the employment and  termination process of its Advisory Representatives. For purposes of these procedures,  the term “employment” encompasses all arrangements between the Firm and  Supervised Persons, regardless of whether the Supervised Person is an employee or  independent contractor for tax purposes. The following information provides a brief  description of the Firm’s policies and procedures as they relate to the employment  process.** 

**5.3.1 Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or  Transfer \(Form U-4\)** 

**It is the responsibility of each Advisory Representative to provide accurate and prompt  information on his Form U-4. Advisory Representatives must report to the Firm any new  information that could require updates, amendments, or revisions on the Form U-4. The  Designated Principal is responsible for determining if certain complaint or disciplinary  incidents require an amendment to Form U-4.** 

**5.3.2 Registration Records** 

**The Designated Principal will ensure that all records of its registered persons are kept  current at all times. The Designated Principal will amend records for its registered  persons no later than thirty \(30\) days after discovery of an event or circumstance that  requires an amendment. If such an event or circumstance is egregious enough to  warrant a statutory disqualification, the Designated Principal will promptly file the  amendment within ten \(10\) days.** 

**Page 22 January 24, 2019** 

**5.3.3 Interview Process** 

**The Designated Principal or other qualified supervisor will thoroughly interview all  potential candidates for employment with the aim of obtaining a comprehensive  overview of each potential employee. The interview process is designed to effectively address such issues as prior work history and relevant experience, disclosure of any  customer complaints and/or regulatory actions in connection with a securities business,  as well as any pending contractual or other obligations that may be material in  consideration for employment.** 

**5.3.4 Background and Due Diligence Review** 

**The Designated Principal or other qualified supervisor will conduct an appropriate  background review of each potential employee prior to making an application for  registration on behalf of that individual with the Firm. If a prospective Advisory  Representative is currently or was previously registered with an investment adviser,  broker-dealer, commodity trading advisor, or futures commission merchant, the Firm  will conduct an initial background review using the Central Registration Depository  \(CRD\) system, FINRA BrokerCheck, the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure, or  the National Future Association’s Background Affiliation Status Information Center  \(BASIC\). Prior to conducting a background review through the CRD system, the  Designated Principal is required to obtain written authorization from the prospective  employee.** 

**The purpose of the background and due diligence review conducted through the CRD  system and/or other means is to identify the existence of customer complaints,  regulatory actions, or any other relevant material. For applicants currently or previously  registered with a FINRA member firm, the Designated Principal will obtain a copy of the  registered representative’s Form U-5 from the applicant or the applicant’s former  employer no later than sixty \(60\) days following the filing of the application to FINRA \(if  applicable\).** 

**5.3.5 Fingerprints** 

**The Firm will obtain a properly completed fingerprint card for each Advisory  Representative. The Designated Principal may require other Supervised Persons to  submit fingerprints, depending on their functions with the Firm.** 

**5.4 Termination Procedures** 

**The following information provides a brief description of the Firm’s policies and  procedures as they relate to the termination process.**

**Page 23 January 24, 2019** 

**5.4.1 Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry  Registration \(Form U-5\)** 

**The Designated Principal is responsible for filing each Advisory Representative’s Form U 5 with the CRD system within thirty \(30\) days of the date of termination. It is the  responsibility of the Firm to ensure that all forwarding U-5 Forms are properly  completed with all of the necessary and accurate information prior to sending such  documents to CRD. In addition to forwarding the Form U-5 to CRD, the Firm is  responsible for forwarding a copy of the Form U-5 to the former employee. The  Designated Principal will determine if certain complaint or disciplinary incidents must be  reported on the Form U-5.**  

**5.4.2 Voluntary Termination** 

**Advisory Representatives must immediately notify the Designated Principal if they  decide to voluntarily leave the Firm. Regardless of the reason for termination, the  Designated Principal must secure all required books and records from the Advisory**  

**Representative and, to the extent possible, ensure such records are not reproduced or  removed from the Firm’s premises.** 

**5.4.3 Involuntary Termination** 

**When an Advisory Representative is terminated due to a violation of internal policy,  industry regulations, or unethical business practices, the CCO should \(1\) immediately  determine the specific reason\(s\) for the termination and any alleged or actual violations,  and \(2\) assess the need to report such violations to regulatory or legal authorities.  Advisory Representatives who are terminated for cause may be asked to leave the  premises immediately and not be permitted to return.** 

**The notification regarding a termination for cause must be objective and fairly present  the facts. Therefore, all U-5 Forms for individuals terminated for cause will be reviewed  by the CCO prior to submission to ensure all necessary information is included. Prior to**  

**or at the time of termination, the Designated Principal should secure all books and  records of the Advisory Representative, especially if the Firm suspects he might remove  or reproduce such records upon learning of his termination.** 

**5.5 Statutorily Disqualified Personnel** 

**As a result of a possible suspension or revocation of a license or registration \(or other  disqualifying event\), some persons may be subject to statutory disqualifications  pursuant to Section 3\(a\)\(39\) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although it is the  Firm’s general policy not to associate with individuals who are or have been statutorily  disqualified, the Firm may elect to employ an individual subject to a statutory** 

**Page 24 January 24, 2019** 

**disqualification under exceptional circumstances and with the CCO’s approval. Prior to  employing a statutorily disqualified person, the CCO must first assess whether the Firm’s  association with the individual is permissible. This assessment is best made by a  securities attorney. Section 203\(f\) of the Investment Advisers Act makes it unlawful for  an investment adviser to associate with a statutorily disqualified person unless the SEC  formally consents to the association.** 

| **6. GENERAL CONDUCT** |
| :--- |


**6.1 Gifts and Entertainment** 

**Advisory Representatives are prohibited from accepting anything of value that might  influence their investment decisions or serve to reward them in connection with their  investment advisory activities. Additionally, Advisory Representatives are expected to**  

**refrain from knowingly conducting advisory business with any individuals or entities that  use gifts or other items of value to bribe or influence others.** 

**No Supervised Person or member of his immediate family may accept any gift from any  client or other person that is not clearly within the list of exceptions below.  Furthermore, no Supervised Person may give anything of value to another person unless  it meets an exception below. The matters described below generally do not create a risk  of conflict of interest because they are ordinary or accepted business practices and do  not imply any return of favor on the part of the receiving person. If a gift is clearly within  these exceptions, the Designated Principal does not need to approve it. If Supervised  Persons or immediate family members receive a gift from a client or other person that  does not meet these exceptions, they must return the gift, refuse the offer, or request  and receive approval of the gift from the Designated Principal.** 

**• Ordinary Business Entertainment and Courtesies — This exception is available  for entertainment associated with business meetings or business discussions,  including meals, sporting events, charitable events, or golf outings. Such business  entertainment and courtesies must not be so excessive that that they could not  be treated as a legitimate business expense. Lavish or extravagant entertainment  should not be accepted unless the Designated Principal gives prior approval and  the Firm reimburses the costs to the host. Similarly, travel expenses may not be  accepted from a customer or vendor without prior approval of the Designated  Principal if the purpose of travel is business entertainment. Advisory  Representatives may not rely on this exception for gifts that are incidental to  business entertainment \(e.g., golf equipment given during a golf outing\), since  any gifts given or received during the course of business entertainment or  business meetings are still considered gifts.**

**Page 25 January 24, 2019** 

**• Client- or Vendor-Sponsored Meetings — This exception applies to meetings  that have a predominant business purpose \(as opposed to a purpose of business  entertainment\). When such meetings entail payment for travel, overnight  accommodations, meals, and entertainment, such amenities must be ordinary  business expenses. Payment of expenses for any person accompanying a  Supervised Person \(other than another Supervised Person of the Firm\) is  prohibited without the prior approval of the Designated Principal.** 

**• Expressions of Courtesy and Appreciation — This exception applies to gifts of  items such as fruit, flowers, food, wine, or candy given with monetary value of  less than $100. Such gifts must not total more than $100 per individual recipient  per year.** 

**• Personal Gifts — This exception applies to personal gifts received solely because  of kinship, marriage, or social relationships, and not because of any business  relationship.**  

**• Promotional Items — This exception is available for unsolicited advertising or  promotional materials that are generally given as promotional or marketing gifts.  The gift must be of nominal value to qualify for this exception.** 

**6.2 Political Contributions and “Pay-to-Play” Policies** 

**Investment advisers that seek to influence government officials’ awards of advisory  contracts by making or soliciting political contributions to those officials are engaging in  an unethical and often illegal practice known as “pay-to-play.” The Firm and its  Supervised Persons are strictly prohibited from making political contributions with the  intent to influence government officials who are in a position to award investment  advisory contracts to the Firm.**  

**6.2.1 Restrictions on the Receipt of Advisory Fees** 

**With limited exceptions, the Firm is prohibited from being compensated for providing  advisory services to a government client for two years after the Firm or certain of its  executives or employees make a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates  associated with the government client.** 

**6.2.2 Restrictions on Payments for the Solicitation of Clients or Investors** 

**The Firm and its Supervised Persons are prohibited from providing or agreeing to  provide, directly or indirectly, payment to any person to solicit a government entity for  investment advisory services on behalf of the Firm unless such person is a regulated  person or is an executive officer \(or a person with a similar status or function\) or  employee of the Firm.**

**Page 26 January 24, 2019** 

**6.2.3 Restrictions on the Coordination or Solicitation of  Contributions** 

**The Firm and its Supervised Persons are further prohibited from coordinating, or  soliciting any person or political action committee to make, any: \(1\) contribution to an  official of a government entity to which the Firm is providing or seeking to provide  investment advisory services; or \(2\) payment to a political party of a state or locality  where the Firm is providing or seeking to provide investment advisory services to a  government entity.**  

**6.2.4 Government Clients** 

**Government clients are any clients that are government entities, regardless of their size.  Government entity is defined as any state or political subdivision of a state. Government  clients may range in size from small local townships to large public pension plans. The  Firm will maintain a list of its government clients. Government entities that invest in the  fund will be deemed government clients of the Firm.** 

**6.2.5 Pre-Clearance of Political Contributions** 

**If any Supervised Person wishes to make a political contribution to any state or local  government entity, official, candidate, political party, or political action committee, the  Supervised Person must seek pre-clearance from the Firm’s Designated Principal  whenever the total contribution to be made exceeds $150. Total contribution is the sum  of the proposed contribution and any prior contributions made directly or indirectly to  the same entity or person. For example, a Supervised Person who previously  contributed $100 and would like to contribute another $100 has a total contribution of  $200. Since $200 exceeds the $150 contribution limit by $50, the Supervised Person  must obtain pre-clearance on the second contribution of $100 or reduce the size of the  second contribution to $50.**  

**The $150 contribution limit is increased to $350 for Supervised Persons who are eligible  to vote in the election of the candidate or official. Thus, if the Supervised Person is  eligible to vote, pre-clearance is not needed unless the total contribution exceeds $350.  Both the $150 and $350 contribution limits apply to each election, so political  contributions made to a candidate in a prior election will not count toward subsequent  elections for the same candidate or official.** 

**Note: Any Supervised Persons involved in soliciting the business of municipalities must  be mindful of MSRB Rule G-37 and should keep political contributions at or below $250  to avoid triggering restrictions on their business. Supervised Persons who are governed  by MSRB Rule G-37 may make political contributions only to officials for whom they are  entitled to vote.**

**Page 27 January 24, 2019** 

**6.2.6 Contributions** 

**To combat pay-to-play practices, the SEC defines “contributions” broadly to include any  gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made for: \(1\)  the purpose of influencing any election for federal, state, or local office; \(2\) payment of  debt incurred in connection with any such election; or \(3\) transition or inaugural**  

**expenses of the successful candidate for state or local office. Supervised Persons may  not participate in any indirect action that would be prohibited if the same action was  done directly.** 

**6.2.7 Charitable Donations** 

**Supervised Persons may not make contributions to charities with the intention of  influencing such charities to become clients or investors in the fund. Supervised Persons  are encouraged to notify the CCO if they perceive an actual or apparent conflict of  interest in connection with any charitable contribution.** 

**6.2.8 Public Office** 

**Supervised Persons are required to obtain written pre-approval from the CCO prior to  running for any public office. Supervised Persons will not be allowed to hold a public  office if it presents any actual or apparent conflict of interest with the Firm's business  activities.** 

**6.3 Outside Business Activities** 

**All Advisory Representatives will need to seek the Firm’s prior approval to engage in  business activities outside of their employment with the Firm. Advisory Representatives  will need to submit a request and provide information about: \(i\) the nature of the  outside business activities; \(ii\) the name of the organization; \(iii\) any compensation; and  \(iv\) the time demands of the activities. All Advisory Representatives are also required to  annually update the Firm regarding their outside business activities. Additionally, all  Advisory Representatives are responsible for ensuring that outside business activities  are correctly reflected on their respective Form U-4s. Pre-approval will not be required  for outside activities related to charities, non-profit organizations, clubs, or trade  associations.** 

**6.3.1 Service as a Director of a Public Company** 

**As set forth in the Firm’s code of ethics, Advisory Representatives may not serve as a  director on the board of a publicly traded company, absent a prior determination by the  CCO of the Firm that such board service would not be inconsistent with the interests of  the Firm or its affiliates.**

**Page 28 January 24, 2019** 

**6.4 Private Securities Transactions** 

**Any Supervised Persons who are or become associated with a broker-dealer are subject  to FINRA’s rule concerning private securities transactions. In accordance with FINRA  Rule 3280, “Prior to participating in any private securities transaction, an associated  person shall provide written notice to the member with which he is associated  describing in detail the proposed transaction and the person's proposed role therein  and stating whether he has received or may receive selling compensation in connection  with the transaction; provided however that, in the case of a series of related  transactions in which no selling compensation has been or will be received, an  associated person may provide a single written notice.” All Supervised Persons,  including those not associated with a broker-dealer, are prohibited from soliciting or  transacting any type of securities business away from the Firm without prior written  approval.** 

**6.5 Communications with Clients** 

**Each communication to a client or the general public must be consistent with the  following policies and guidelines:** 

**• All communications must be truthful and may not be misleading or omit a  material fact.** 

**• Communications may not include any promises of specific results or forecasts of  future returns.** 

**• When discussing investments, the risks of such investments and the possibility  that their value may increase or decrease must be disclosed.** 

**• Communication may contain comparisons of the Firm with competitors  regarding fees, performance, and other matters only if factual information  supports such comparisons.** 

**• Material that contains the legend "Internal Use Only" or similar legends may not  be provided to clients or other persons who are not Supervised Persons of the  Firm.** 

**• Employees should use stationery and business cards bearing the Firm's name  and/or logo for business purposes, unless the CCO approves in writing the use of  nonstandard stationery or business cards.** 

**• Neither tax nor legal advice will be provided to clients in communications.** 

**Page 29 January 24, 2019** 

**6.6 Complaints from Advisory Clients or Investors** 

**Supervised Persons must promptly report any complaint to the Firm. A “complaint” is  defined as any written statement of a client or any person acting on behalf of a client  alleging a grievance involving the activities of those persons under the control of the**  

**Firm in connection with the Firm’s business as an investment adviser. Although this  formal definition specifies that a complaint be in writing, the Firm also requires  Supervised Persons to promptly report oral complaints or grievances. Supervised  Persons should not attempt to resolve a complaint on their own.** 

**The Designated Principal is responsible for educating Supervised Persons on the  procedures to follow if they receive a complaint. The Designated Principal will train an  employee to open the mail, recognize a customer complaint, and forward the complaint  to the appropriate Designated Principal. The Designated Principal will ensure that all  Supervised Persons understand the Firm’s electronic communication policy and that  such persons forward any customer complaints that they receive electronically to the  Designated Principal.** 

**6.7 Compliance Training for Employees** 

**Advisory Representatives must complete any training assigned to them. The CCO will  take the following minimum steps to see that the Firm’s personnel are appropriately  informed of and trained with respect to all compliance policies and procedures:**  

**• Whenever material changes are made to the Firm’s policies and procedures, the  CCO will communicate them to all affected employees by holding a meeting or  through any other effective means to communicate and explain the changes.**  

**• If a meeting is called for this purpose, the CCO will maintain a log-in sheet or  other means to evidence which personnel attended the meeting.**  

**• All personnel will be required to complete and sign periodic certifications  acknowledging they understand the policies and procedures in this manual and  in the code of ethics, and certifying that they have not violated any  requirements.** 

**• Not less frequently than annually, a general training session will be conducted by  the CCO to review policies and procedures and applicable rules, regulations, and  laws with personnel. The CCO will maintain a log-in sheet or other means to  evidence which personnel attended the meeting.**

**Page 30 January 24, 2019** 

**6.8 Reporting and Investigation of Compliance Issues** 

**The Firm requires all personnel to be vigilant in helping to prevent and detect errors and  wrongdoing. If any Supervised Person becomes aware of any fraudulent or other illegal,  inappropriate, or unethical action, or of any violation of the Firm’s policies and  procedures, including a violation of this manual or the code of ethics, the Supervised  Person should immediately contact the CCO. If the Supervised Person believes the CCO  is or may be involved in the violation, the Supervised Person should report the matter to  any other senior officer. The information will be treated confidentially and the source  will not be revealed to any other person who may be involved, to the extent practicable  and consistent with what the Firm believes is necessary for the fair and lawful treatment  of those involved.** 

**The CCO or other senior officer to whom a matter has been reported is responsible for  seeing that an investigation into the matter is conducted with due speed and the aim of  determining whether a violation has in fact occurred and, if so, what corrective  measures should be taken. If desired or appropriate, the CCO or investigating officer  may engage outside counsel or other advisors in order to conduct the investigation or  make recommendations as to remedial actions. At the conclusion of any investigation, a  report summarizing the investigation, findings, and any remedial actions taken will be  made to senior management by the CCO or other investigating officer.** 

| **7. CLIENT ACCOUNTS**  |
| :--- |


**Opening client accounts raises important compliance considerations primarily related to  the intake of information and its management. Obtaining reliable information is critical  to an Advisory Representative’s ability to make a determination of the objectives and  risk tolerance of each client. Advisory Representatives must comply with all applicable  disclosure rules.** 

**7.1 Acceptance of Client Accounts** 

**As a matter of policy, the Firm will accept only those investors whose source of wealth  and funds can be reasonably established to be legitimate. The Firm will maintain  accurate, current, and complete information about each client.** 

**7.2 Client Identity and Client Information** 

**The Firm will take reasonable measures to establish the identity of each client.  Identification documents must be current at the time a client enters into an advisory** 

**Page 31 January 24, 2019** 

**agreement with the Firm. The Firm will generally accept an investor only after obtaining  the following information about the client \(as applicable\):** 

**• name, social security number, and age;** 

**• residential or business address;** 

**• telephone number;** 

**• investment objective;** 

**• occupation, employer, and annual income;** 

**• source\(s\) of wealth \(i.e., activity that has generated net worth\); • estimated net worth;** 

**• investment experience;** 

**• marital status and dependents;** 

**• risk tolerance;** 

**• investment time horizon;** 

**• liquidity needs;** 

**• existing holdings;** 

**• source\(s\) of funds and means used to transfer the funds.** 

**7.3 Institutional Investors and Other Entities** 

**The Firm may accept as a client a corporation, partnership, foundation, or other client  that is an entity after:** 

**• reviewing documentary evidence of the proper organization and existence of  such entity;** 

**• understanding the structure of the entity sufficiently to determine the source of  the funds;** 

**• identifying principal owner\(s\) of the entity's shares or beneficial interests; • identifying who controls the entity;** 

**• obtaining a signed corporate resolution or similar authorization that authorizes  the opening of the account; and**  

**• obtaining a signed list of corporate officers or persons in similar capacity  authorized to enter orders and receive statements on behalf of the entity.**

**Page 32 January 24, 2019** 

**7.4 Trust Clients** 

**The Firm may accept a client formed as a trust only after:** 

**• reviewing evidence of its proper formation and existence, along with the identity  of its trustee\(s\);**  

**• understanding the structure of the trust sufficiently to determine the source of  the funds \(e.g., settlor\), the person who controls the trust \(e.g., trustee\), and the  persons who have the power to remove the trustee.** 

**Note: An Advisory Representative who acts as trustee for a client is deemed to have  custody with respect to the trust’s assets. For this reason, the CCO must pre-approve  any arrangement in which an Advisory Representative serves as trustee for an investor.** 

**7.5 Delivery of Privacy Policy** 

**As required by Regulation S-P or other privacy laws, the Firm will deliver or make  available its privacy policy to any client.** 

**7.6 Investment Advisory Contracts** 

**The Investment Advisers Act contains provisions that regulate the contents of  investment advisory contracts. In addition, the SEC has interpreted the antifraud  provisions of the Investment Advisers Act as requiring or prohibiting certain clauses.  Based on these provisions and interpretations, the Firm’s advisory contracts:** 

**• Must contain a clause stating that an adviser cannot assign its advisory contract  without the consent of its client;** 

**• Must not contain any condition, stipulation, or provision binding a client to  waive compliance with any provision of the Investment Advisers Act or related  rules;** 

**• Must not contain hedge clauses that mislead an investor into believing that he or  she has waived a right of action \(e.g., a provision waiving a claim based on “gross  negligence” or “willful misfeasance” without also indicating that advisory clients  have not waived or limited any rights under the federal securities laws or  relevant state laws\); and**  

**• Must not contain a clause calling for performance-based compensation unless  certain conditions are met.**  

**No advisory contract may be entered into by an Advisory Representative unless the  contract is first reviewed and approved by the Firm.** 

**Page 33 January 24, 2019** 

**7.7 Form ADV Delivery and Disclosure** 

**The Firm will deliver or make its Form ADV available to any client. Additionally, at the  time that a referral is made to a third party adviser, the Firm will deliver a current Form  ADV for the third party adviser to the client.** 

**7.8 Client Abuse** 

**Advisory Representatives are to inform the Firm’s CCO, Thomas Tavenner, immediately  upon having “reasonable cause to believe” that an adult is being abused, neglected, or  exploited. Upon being informed of or having “reasonable cause to believe” of adult  abuse, the Firm is considered a mandatory reporter of suspected abuse, neglect, or  exploitation to the county department of job and family services. The Firm will also  contact the client’s trust contact person, if the client identified and provided contact  information for such individual.** 

**7.9 Questionable Request and Demands** 

**The Firm will contact the client’s trusted contact person, if the client identified and  provided contact information for such individual, should any questionable  request/demands be made that are inconsistent with the investor’s profile \(the New  Account Form\) and appear to be a sign of client abuse.**  

| **8. ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROCEDURES AND  CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM** |
| :--- |


**Supervised Persons who are, or become, associated with The Tavenner Company,  Inc., or another broker-dealer, must adhere to the Anti-Money Laundering \(“AML”\)  procedures and Customer Identification Program \(“CIP”\) of The Tavenner  Company, Inc., or another broker-dealer, as applicable. These procedures are set  forth in the written supervisory procedures of The Tavenner Company, Inc. Unlike  broker-dealers, investment advisers are not required by law to establish a formal  AML program.**  

**8.1 Reporting** 

**Supervised Persons must report any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing  to the Designated Principal, who is responsible for investigating the matter and  determining whether the Firm has any obligation under applicable law to file reports  with government officials.**

**Page 34 January 24, 2019** 

| **9. ASSESSING FEES** |
| :--- |


**The Firm assesses fees as specified in its Form ADV disclosure documents and the  advisory agreement with the client.**  

**9.1.1 Assessing Fees** 

**The Firm will receive its fees directly from each third party adviser in accordance with  the advisory agreements entered into between the Firm, the clients, and the third party  advisers. The Designated Principal is responsible for establishing adequate controls for  calculating fees and ensuring that the fees are consistent with the advisory agreement  and disclosures.**  

| **10. PROPRIETARY AND PERSONAL TRADING** |
| :--- |


**10.1 Proprietary Trading** 

**Neither the Firm nor any affiliates are engaged in proprietary trading activities. The Firm  understands that a transaction between a proprietary account and an advisory client  would be deemed a principal transaction under Section 206\(3\) of the Investment  Advisers Act. If the Firm ever acts as principal for its own account or an account of an  affiliate, it will not knowingly effect any sale or purchase with an advisory client. If the  Firm or an affiliate becomes involved in proprietary trading activities, the CCO will  implement additional procedures reasonably designed to ensure that proprietary  trading is conducted in a compliant manner.**  

**10.2 Personal Trading**  

**The Designated Principal is responsible for monitoring the personal trading of Access  Persons. Access Persons must conduct their personal trading in a manner consistent  with the Firm’s code of ethics.** 

**10.2.1 Personal Trading Policy** 

**As stated in the code of ethics, all Access Persons are required to submit holdings  reports and transactions reports to the Designated Principal for review. For holdings  reports, within ten days of becoming associated with the Firm, all access persons are  required to provide the CCO a report of the access person’s current securities holdings  which contains the following information relating to Reportable Securities in which the  access person has a direct or indirect ownership interest, as applicable:** 

**a. The title and type of security**

**Page 35 January 24, 2019** 

**b. The exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number** 

**c. Number of shares** 

**d. Principal amount of each securities position** 

**e. The name of any broker, dealer or bank with which the access person maintains  an account in which securities are held for the access person’s direct or indirect  benefit** 

**f. The date the holdings report is submitted** 

**On January 31 of each year, access persons must submit a holdings report to the CCO  that contains the information listed above as of December 31 of the previous year.** 

**No later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, all access persons are  required to submit transaction reports to the CCO that contain the following  information for each transaction involving a Reportable Security in which the access  person had, or as a result of the transaction acquired, any direct or indirect beneficial  ownership, as applicable:** 

**a. The date of the transaction** 

**b. The title and type of security**  

**c. The exchange ticker symbol or CUSIP number** 

**d. Interest date and maturity date** 

**e. Number of shares** 

**f. Principal amount of each securities position** 

**g. The nature of the transaction \(i.e., purchase, sale or any other type of  acquisition or disposition\)** 

**h. The price of the security at which the transaction was effected** 

**i. The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through which the  transaction was effected** 

**j. The date the transaction report is submitted.** 

**Each transaction report must include, at a minimum, all transactions that were effected  during the quarter.** 

**10.2.2 Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plans** 

**The Firm’s code of ethics is not intended to prevent any Access Person from  participating in or continuing to participate in an automatic reinvestment program  under which dividends declared and paid by the issuer are reinvested in additional** 

**Page 36 January 24, 2019** 

**shares of the same issuer under a plan offered and administered by the issuer of any  security owned in accordance with the provisions of the code of ethics.** 

**10.2.3 Market Timing**  

**All Firm personnel are prohibited from short-term trading or market timing in mutual  fund shares. Short-term trading is defined as a substantial redemption within 6 months  of a purchase and market timing is defined as a redemption within 30 days of a  purchase. Certain exceptions may be granted where the purchase was made under an  automatic dividend reinvestment, an automatic monthly investment, or in other  exceptional cases. If a transaction meets an exception but other indications of market  timing exist, the transaction will not be allowed.** 

| **11. TRADING PRACTICES** |
| :--- |


**The Firm does not directly manage client assets. Asset management services are  provided by unaffiliated third party advisers. The Firm will not engage in any trading  activities on behalf of itself or clients.** 

| **12. SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS** |
| :--- |


**12.1 Custody** 

**The Firm and its Advisory Representatives are prohibited from accepting or maintaining  custody of client funds or securities. It is imperative that Supervised Persons  understand the definition of custody to avoid inadvertently violating the Firm’s policies  and procedures.**  

**12.2 Definition of Custody** 

**Under SEC Rule 206\(4\)-2, the SEC defines custody very broadly as holding directly or  indirectly client funds or securities or having the authority to obtain possession of them.  Custody includes:** 

**1. possession of client funds or securities \(but not of checks drawn by clients and  made payable to third parties \) unless the Firm receives them inadvertently and  returns them to the sender promptly but in any case within three business days  after receiving them;**  

**Important: Although the SEC’s definition of custody would not include the  inadvertent receipt of funds or securities that are returned to the sender within  three business days, it is the Firm’s policy to return funds and securities to the** 

**Page 37 January 24, 2019** 

**sender promptly. “Promptly” means on the same day that the check or securities  are received but in no case later than noon of the business day following receipt.** 

**2. any arrangement \(including a general power of attorney \) under which the Firm  is authorized or permitted to withdraw client funds or securities maintained with  a custodian upon the Firm’s instructions to the custodian; and** 

**3. any capacity \(such as general partner of a limited partnership, managing  member of a limited liability company or a comparable position for another type  of pooled investment vehicle or trustee of a trust\) that gives the Firm or a  Supervised Person legal ownership of or access to client funds or securities.** 

**This formal definition of custody has been clarified and explained through a series of a  communications from the SEC called Staff Responses to Questions About Amended  Custody Rule. As a means to monitor the SEC’s current stance on various custody  practices, the Designated Principal should periodically review newly released versions of  the SEC’s responses to questions about custody, which are posted online at  www.sec.gov .** 

**12.3 Examples of Custody** 

**An Advisory Representative will be deemed to have custody if he directly or indirectly  holds client funds or securities, has any authority to obtain possession of them, or has  the ability to appropriate them. It is important to note that actual possession of client  funds or securities is not necessary to establish custody — access to or control of the**  

**funds or securities is sufficient. To avoid inadvertently taking custody of client funds or  securities, Advisory Representatives must have a thorough understanding of what  constitutes custody. For this reason, the Firm has compiled a list of custody situations  prohibited by the Firm.** 

**12.3.1 Prohibited Forms of Custody** 

**Examples of custody prohibited by the Firm include situations in which an Advisory  Representative:** 

**1. Has signatory power over a client's checking account;** 

**2. Receives third party checks, which are checks drawn on an account not  belonging to the client. Advisory Representatives are prohibited from accepting  third party checks from advisory clients.** 

**3. Receives stock certificates. Advisory Representatives are prohibited from  accepting securities from advisory clients.** 

**Page 38 January 24, 2019** 

**4. Has a general power of attorney over a client’s account, even if such client is a  family member;**  

**5. Maintains an omnibus-type account in his own name at a broker or bank in  which client securities are maintained after trades settle;** 

**6. Obtains his advisory fees by directly billing client custodians without effective  oversight by the client or an independent party;** 

**7. Serves as a trustee, conservator, or executor for a client who is not a family  member;** 

**8. Has the ability to print client checks at the branch office;** 

**9. Possesses the username and password to a client’s account if such login  credentials allow the disbursement of funds;** 

**10. Holds a client’s mail containing a client’s funds or securities, even if the Advisory  Representative does not know whether the mail contains client funds or  securities;** 

**11. Accepts checks not made payable to the appropriate clearing firm, custodian,  fund company, or other proper third party;** 

**12. Accepts checks made payable to the Firm and such checks do not constitute  payment for advisory services;** 

**13. Has the ability to receive directly the proceeds of a redemption or liquidation;** 

**14. Has the unilateral ability to wire funds from client accounts without  authorization; or** 

**The aforementioned list is not inclusive of all instances in which the Firm could be  deemed to have custody. Therefore, Advisory Representatives should consult with the  Designated Principal if they have any questions or believe a business practice might  constitute custody.**  

**An Advisory Representative is expected to notify the Designated Principal if he or  another Supervised Person inadvertently takes custody of client funds or securities.  Notification to the Designated Principal allows the Firm to document the incident and  take the appropriate corrective action. Due to the complexity of custody situations, it is  the Firm’s policy not to punish Supervised Persons who, in good faith, inadvertently take  custody of client funds or securities but immediately report the incident upon  recognizing it as custody. On the other hand, intentional violations of the Firm’s custody  procedures, especially repeat violations, may result in harsh discipline, including  termination for cause.**

**Page 39 January 24, 2019** 

**The Designated Principal will perform a periodic assessment of the Firm’s business to  ascertain whether the Firm or its Advisory Representatives have taken custody of client  funds or securities in an impermissible manner. The CCO is responsible for overseeing  the Firm’s custody practices and the safeguarding of client funds and securities.** 

**12.3.2 Permitted Forms of Custody** 

**The Firm currently permits no form of custody. If the Firm changes its policy in the  future, this section will be used to provide a description of permissible forms of custody.** 

**12.3.3 Exceptions** 

**The Firm will not permit any exceptions to the prohibition of accepting custody of client  funds or securities.**  

**12.4 Surprise Examination** 

**With limited exceptions, investment advisers with custody must subject themselves to  annual surprise examinations conducted by an independent accountant registered with,  and subject to regular inspection by, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  \(PCAOB\). The purpose of these surprise examination is to verify the funds and securities  of which the Firm has custody. The CCO is responsible for engaging an accountant and  ensuring that the annual surprise examination is timely completed for any calendar year  in which the Firm has custody of client funds or securities.** 

**As neither the Firm nor Advisory Representative will have or be permitted to have  custody of client’s securities or funds, surprise examinations will not be conducted upon  the Firm.** 

**12.5 Internal Control Report** 

**Investment advisers or affiliates that act as qualified custodians of client funds or  securities must obtain an annual internal control report. The CCO is responsible for  determining the necessity of an internal control report and will engage an accountant if  the need arises.** 

**12.6 Use of Qualified Custodian** 

**With limited exceptions, the Firm must use a qualified custodian to maintain the funds  and securities of its clients. Qualified custodian is defined in SEC Rule 206\(4\)-2 and  includes registered broker-dealers, registered futures commission merchants, many  banks, and certain foreign financial institutions. Because all asset management services  for the Firm’s clients are provided by unaffiliated third party advisers, it is the  responsibility of the third party advisers to maintain client funds with a qualified** 

**Page 40 January 24, 2019** 

**custodian, to notify clients of the qualified custodian’s name, address, and the manner  in which funds or securities are maintained, and to have a reasonable basis for believing  that the qualified custodian sends an account statement, at least quarterly, to each  client.**  

**12.7 Inadvertent Receipt of Funds or Securities** 

**If the Firm inadvertently receives client funds or securities that cannot be accepted,  Supervised Persons should follow these guidelines to ensure that the Firm avoids  assuming custody of the funds or securities:** 

**1. Notify the Designated Principal – Immediately notify the Designated Principal or  another supervisor that the Firm has received a check or securities that cannot  be accepted. “Immediately” means as soon as the Firm opens an envelope  containing, or otherwise receives, unacceptable checks or securities. The  possession of the check or securities poses a compliance risk to the Firm, and the  Designated Principal will want to oversee the proper handling of the check or  securities. Notification to the Designated Principal may be made orally or in  writing. Upon receiving notification, the Designated Principal may give specific  instructions that must be followed.** 

**2. Document Receipt of the Funds or Securities – Fill out all the required fields on  the Firm’s checks/securities received and forwarded blotter.** 

**3. Make Photocopies of the Funds or Securities – Use a photocopier or scanner to  copy both sides of the check or securities for recordkeeping purposes.** 

**4. Return the Funds or Securities to the Sender – Promptly mail the check or  securities back to the sender using a safe delivery method \(preferably one that  allows for tracking\). “Promptly” means on the same day that the check or  securities are received but in no case later than noon of the business day  following receipt. \(Any check or securities temporarily in the Firm’s possession  must be safeguarded at all times.\) Include a letter with the returned check or  securities explaining why the check or securities are being returned and how the  sender may deliver the check or securities in the future. It is a good practice to  verify that the returned check or securities are received by the intended  recipient, which can usually be accomplished by tracking the letter or calling the  intended recipient.** 

**5. Maintain Records –Ensure that the Firm maintains the records described above  and any other documentation evidencing the prompt return of the inadvertently  received check or securities.**

**Page 41 January 24, 2019** 

**The Designated Principal has the authority to implement additional policies and  procedures to ensure the proper handling and return of inadvertently received funds or  securities. The Designated Principal is responsible for training and overseeing those  Supervised Persons who receive mail or are otherwise in a position to inadvertently  receive checks or securities.** 

| **13. DISCLOSURE ACCURACY** |
| :--- |


**Fundamental to the Investment Advisers Act is the investment adviser’s fiduciary duty  to act in the best interests of its clients and to place its clients' interests before its own.  In the role of fiduciary, the Firm and its Advisory Representatives have the affirmative  duty of utmost good faith and full and fair disclosure of all material facts. The Firm is  required to disclose any facts that might cause it or its Advisory Representatives to  render advice that is not disinterested.**  

**13.1 Failure to Disclose** 

**Examples of failures to disclose material information to clients include the following  scenarios:** 

**• The Firm fails to disclose all fees that a client would pay in connection with the  advisory contract, including how fees are charged and whether fees are  negotiable;** 

**• The Firm fails to disclose an affiliation with a broker-dealer, issuer, or other  financial services company;** 

**• The Firm fails to disclose that it is in a precarious financial condition that is likely  to impair its ability to meet contractual commitments to clients.** 

**The Designated Principal is responsible for all disclosures, including those found in  advisory agreements, contracts, and Form ADV.**  

**13.2 Financial, Disciplinary, and Other Material  Disclosures** 

**If applicable, the Designated Principal must consider other relevant disclosures to  clients, including the following financial and disciplinary events:** 

**• A financial condition of the Firm that is reasonably likely to impair the ability of  the Firm to meet contractual commitments to clients;** 

**• A legal or disciplinary event that is material to an evaluation of the Firm's  integrity or ability to meet contractual commitments to clients;**

**Page 42 January 24, 2019** 

**• A criminal or civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction in which the Firm or  a Management Person \(defined below\) was convicted, pleaded guilty or “no  contest'' to a felony or misdemeanor or is the named subject of a pending  criminal proceeding, and such action involved an investment-related business;  fraud, false statements, or omissions; wrongful taking of property; or bribery,  forgery, counterfeiting, or extortion;**  

**• The Firm’s or a Management Person’s involvement in a violation of an  investment-related statute or regulation;** 

**• Proceedings by a self-regulatory organization in which the Firm or a  Management Person was the subject of an order that barred or suspended  membership or resulted in a fine more than $2,500.** 

**The aforementioned events do not form an exhaustive list of disclosures that would be  deemed material. On a case-by-case basis, the Designated Principal must make the  determination whether an item requires disclosure. Attorneys or consultants may be  utilized to assist in the determination.** 

**Definition of Management Person – A “Management Person” is any person with the  power to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or  policies of the Firm or to determine the investment advice given to clients.** 

**13.3 Written Disclosure Brochure** 

**SEC Rule 204-3 under the Advisers Act, commonly referred to as the "brochure rule,"  generally requires every investment adviser to deliver to each client or prospective  client a Form ADV Part 2A \(brochure\) and Part 2B \(brochure supplement\) describing the  adviser's business practices, conflicts of interest, and background of the investment  adviser and its advisory personnel. An adviser must deliver the brochure to a client  before or at the time the adviser enters into an investment advisory contract with a  client. An adviser must deliver to each client or prospective client a current brochure  supplement for a supervised person before or at the time that supervised person begins  to provide advisory services to the client.** 

**The Designated Principal is responsible for compliance with the brochure rule. It is the  Firm’s policy to deliver the brochure and brochure supplements to investors in the fund.** 

**13.4 Annual Delivery or Offer** 

**Annually within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year and without charge, if there are  material changes in the brochure since the last updating amendment, the Firm will  deliver to each client to whom it must deliver a brochure either:**

**Page 43 January 24, 2019** 

**1. A copy of the current \(updated\) brochure that includes the summary of material  changes as required by Item 2 of Form ADV, Part 2A; or** 

**2. A summary of material changes that offers to provide the current brochure  without charge, accompanied by the website address \(if available\) and an email  address and a telephone number by which a client may obtain the current  brochure from the Firm, and the website address for obtaining information  about the Firm through the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure \(IAPD\) system.**  

**The Designated Principal is responsible for ensuring that the annual delivery or offer is  made. It is the Firm’s policy to deliver or offer the Form ADV to investors within the  fund.** 

**13.5 Form ADV Annual Updating Amendment** 

**The Designated Principal will amend Form ADV each year by filing an annual updating  amendment within ninety days after fiscal year end. Part 1 and Part 2A is filed  electronically through IARD.**  

| **14. MARKETING ADVISORY SERVICES** |
| :--- |


**Rule 206\(4\)-1 defines the term “advertisement” very broadly to include any notice,  circular, letter, or other written communication addressed to more than one person, or  any announcement in any publication or by radio or television, which offers:** 

**1. any analysis, report, or publication concerning securities, or which is to be used  in making any determination as to when to buy or sell any security, or which  security to buy or sell; or** 

**2. any graph, chart, formula, or other device to be used in making any  determination as to when to buy or sell any security, or which security to buy or  sell; or** 

**3. any other investment advisory service with regard to securities.** 

**Accordingly, advertisements could include written communications to investors and  potential investors, such as flip books, marketing materials, client reports, portfolio  commentary, and similar documents. All of these materials are subject to the general  antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and are subject to certain content  restrictions. Therefore, Advisory Representatives must obtain approval from the CCO  before they send any written communications qualifying as an advertisement to clients  or prospective clients.**

**Page 44 January 24, 2019** 

**14.1 Specific Restrictions under the Investment Advisers  Act** 

**The Investment Advisers Act places specific restrictions on the content of  advertisements. Accordingly, the Firm may not publish, circulate, or distribute any  advertisement which:** 

**1. Refers, directly or indirectly, to any testimonial concerning the Firm or  concerning any advice, analysis, report, or other service rendered by the Firm;** 

**2. Refers, directly or indirectly, to past specific recommendations of the Firm that  were or would have been profitable to any person, unless the advertisement  includes, or offers to furnish, a list of all recommendations made by the Firm  within at least the preceding year;** 

**3. Represents, directly or indirectly, that any graph, chart, formula, or other device  can in and of itself be used to determine which securities to buy or sell, or when  to buy or sell them; or which represents directly or indirectly, that any graph,  chart, formula, or other device being offered will assist any person in making his  own decisions as to which securities to buy, sell, or when to buy or sell them,  without prominently disclosing the limitations and difficulties with respect to its  use;**  

**4. Contains any statement to the effect that any report, analysis, or other service  will be furnished free of charge, unless such report, analysis, or other service  actually is or will be furnished entirely free and without any condition or  obligation, directly or indirectly; or**  

**5. Contains any untrue statement of a material fact, or is otherwise false or  misleading.** 

**14.2 Use of Performance Data** 

**The SEC places additional restrictions on the use of performance data in the  advertisements of investment advisers. Performance data must:** 

**• Be presented net of fees \(except in very limited circumstances\);**  

**• Disclose the effect of material market or economic conditions on the results  listed;**  

**• Disclose whether and to what extent the results listed reflect the reinvestment  of dividends or other earnings;**  

**• Disclose the possibility of loss when making claims about potential profits;** 

**Page 45 January 24, 2019** 

**• Include a representative mix of accounts rather than selectively choosing  accounts that will produce misleadingly high returns \(also known as cherry  picking\);**  

**• Comply with additional restrictions if model results are used; and** 

**• Not use performance generated at a previous adviser except if certain conditions  are satisfied.** 

**14.2.1 Portability of Performance Information** 

**The Firm is limited in its ability to provide performance information generated by an  Advisory Representative while he worked at a prior firm. To use a person’s prior  performance, the Firm generally must make certain that \(i\) no other person played a  significant role in generating the performance; \(ii\) the accounts managed by the person  currently are similar to the accounts managed at the prior firm; \(iii\) all accounts  managed in a substantially similar manner are included in the performance calculation;  and \(iv\) the person has the supporting records necessary to demonstrate the calculation  of the performance results used in any advertisement. Any use of prior performance  must be approved in advance by the CCO.** 

**14.2.2 Records to Support Performance** 

**The Firm must maintain books and records necessary to demonstrate the calculation of  any advertised performance. The Firm may satisfy this requirement by keeping \(i\) client  account statements, assuming the account statements reflect all debits, credits, and  other transactions in a client’s account for the period of the statement, and \(ii\) all  worksheets necessary to demonstrate the calculation of the performance or rate of  return.** 

**14.2.3 Global Investment Performance Standards \(GIPS\) The SEC does not require the use of the Global Investment Performance Standards  \(GIPS\) and has not officially endorsed these investment performance measurement  standards. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against  investment advisers who have falsely claimed to be “GIPS compliant.” Accordingly, prior  approval must be received from the CCO before any claim or suggestion may be made in  any communication \(including in any response to a request for a proposal\) that  performance information for any account or fund is “GIPS compliant.”** 

**14.2.4 Aberrational Performance** 

**The SEC has an initiative to combat investment fraud by identifying abnormal  investment performance through the use of proprietary risk analytics. This initiative is** 

**Page 46 January 24, 2019** 

**currently focused on hedge fund returns but has the potential to be used to analyze the  returns of any investment adviser presenting performance information.**  

**14.3 Client Solicitations** 

**Rule 206\(4\)-3 limits the ability of investment advisers to make cash payments in return  for client solicitations. The client solicitation rule focuses primarily on disclosure. Cash  solicitation arrangements can arise in several different situations, including when \(1\) an  Advisory Representative agrees to split a portion of his fees with another person or  entity for referrals, or \(2\) the Firm commits itself to make fixed cash payments to those  persons or entities that introduce clients. Any cash solicitation arrangement must:** 

**• Be in writing;** 

**• Not be made with persons statutorily disqualified from association with an  investment adviser;** 

**• Ensure that potential clients are informed of the solicitation arrangement;**  

**• Ensure, in the case of third-party solicitors \(i.e., non-affiliates\), that potential  investors receive the investment adviser’s Form ADV, as well as a separate  written disclosure document from the third-party solicitor.** 

**• Ensure, in the case of affiliated solicitors who do not provide a separate written  disclosure document, that a reasonable person would infer from the objective  circumstances that the solicitor has an affiliation with the Firm.** 

**All solicitation arrangements, whether with employees of an affiliate or with unaffiliated  persons or entities, must be pre-cleared with the CCO. Form ADV must also disclose the  use of solicitors. An executed copy of any solicitation agreement must be sent to the  CCO and maintained in the Firm’s records.**  

| **15. CORRESPONDENCE** |
| :--- |


**The Firm's policies and procedures on correspondence overlap with more specific  policies on advertising and electronic communications. These policies and procedures  are additive and should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this manual.** 

**15.1 Definition of Correspondence** 

**Correspondence includes incoming and outgoing written communications to clients or  prospective clients, regardless of the method of transmission \(mail, facsimile, personal  delivery, courier services, electronic mail, etc.\). Correspondence also includes portfolio  seminars, panel presentations, prepared speeches, and other types of information**  

**originating from a Supervised Person and provided to one or more clients or prospective** 

**Page 47 January 24, 2019** 

**clients. Interactive conversations \(e.g., personal meetings, telephone conversations  other than scripted sales calls\) generally are not considered correspondence.** 

**15.2 Outgoing Correspondence** 

**The Designated Principal is responsible for ensuring that outgoing correspondence is  reviewed, approved, and retained in compliance with the following guidelines and the  applicable laws, rules, and regulations governing the activities of the Firm. The  Designated Principal is responsible for implementing procedures reasonably designed to  ensure that correspondence is being adequately reviewed. The Designated Principal has  the authority to require pre-approval for certain types of correspondence. Moreover,  the Designated Principal may subject certain Supervised Persons to augmented  correspondence reviews based on various risk factors.** 

**Guidelines for Outgoing Correspondence** 

**• Supervised Persons must send and receive all correspondence at such locations  and through such channels as instructed by the Firm. Unless authorized by the  Firm, Supervised Persons should not be sending or receiving correspondence of a  business nature, including electronic correspondence, through their home  address or home computer. Text messaging is not an approved or acceptable  means for conducting the Firm’s business.** 

**• Correspondence must be truthful and not misleading.**  

**• Good taste is required. The use of obscenity or profanity reflects very poorly on  the Firm.** 

**• Exaggerated or flamboyant language should be avoided.** 

**• Projections and predictions are not permitted.** 

**• Correspondence regarding securities sold by prospectus generally is not  permitted.** 

**• No Supervised Person is authorized to make any statements or supply any  information about a security that is the subject of a securities offering other than  the information contained in offering materials that have been approved for  such offering.** 

**• The Firm prohibits photocopying and distributing copyrighted material in  violation of copyright law.** 

**• Use of the Firm's letterhead and other official stationery is limited to matters  related to the Firm’s business.**

**Page 48 January 24, 2019** 

**• No material marked "For Internal Use" or something to this effect may be sent to  anyone outside the Firm.**  

**15.3 Incoming Correspondence** 

**The Designated Principal or a qualified designee will open and review incoming  correspondence. Correspondence subject to this policy includes letters, facsimiles,  courier deliveries, and other forms of communication, including communications  marked "personal," "confidential," or words to this effect.**  

**Guidelines for Incoming Correspondence** 

**• Obvious non-client correspondence may be forwarded directly to the addressee.** 

**• Requests for audit letters, references, verification of account positions, and the  like will be forwarded directly to the applicable personnel for handling and  response.** 

**• Complaints will be immediately forwarded to the CCO and supervisory personnel  for handling and reply.** 

**• Original client correspondence will be retained in the Firm’s files.** 

**• Correspondence containing checks or securities must be immediately processed  to ensure proper handling of the checks or securities.**  

**15.4 Correspondence Reviews** 

**Review of correspondence may be evidenced as deemed appropriate by the Designated  Principal or qualified designee who conducts correspondence reviews. Acceptable  means of evidencing review include, among other things, the following:** 

**• Initialing and dating the Firm’s file copy of written correspondence. • Electronically signing or initialing the Firm’s electronic file copy. • Completing a log or task that documents the review.** 

**15.5 Recordkeeping** 

**Copies of correspondence will be maintained as required by applicable SEC rules and  state regulations. Supervised Persons are prohibited from destroying correspondence or  moving it off-site unless specifically instructed to do so by the Designated Principal.**

**Page 49 January 24, 2019** 

**15.6 Personal Mail** 

**Supervised Persons should direct all personal mail to their home address. Personal mail  may not be distinguishable from the Firm’s mail and is subject to the Firm's review of  incoming mail. Mail marked “personal” or “confidential” will be opened by the Firm.** 

**15.7 Cautionary and Protective Legends** 

**If the Firm elects to send clients summary account statements, the SEC requires the Firm  to include a cautionary legend that urges clients to compare the account statements  they receive from the custodian with those they receive from the Firm. Whereas certain  legends are required by law or regulation, the use of others are deemed a best practice.  For example, it is advisable to use protective legends that urge clients to notify their  Advisory Representatives in the event of any changes to their financial position or  investment objectives, or if they wish to impose, add, or modify reasonable restrictions  to the management of their accounts. The Designated Principal will consider the need  for protective legends and, if warranted, require their use on correspondence.**  

**15.8 Email, Social Media, and Electronic**  

**Communications** 

**Incoming and outgoing e-mail is correspondence and will be subject to the Firm’s  correspondence reviews. The Firm’s procedures governing email, social media, and  other electronic communications are found within this manual under the section titled  “Electronic Communications.”** 

| **16. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS** |
| :--- |


**The Designated Principal is responsible for ensuring that the Firm’s electronic  communications systems are being utilized for authorized business purposes in  conformance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This policy extends to off hours usage of electronic communications systems and where permitted, to  communications concerning the Firm’s business on home, personal, or other electronic  communications systems. As used in this policy, the term "electronic communications"  includes, but is not necessarily limited to, business communications made through any  of the following media approved by the Firm:** 

**1. Telephone \(including internet telephony devices and related protocols\); 2. Electronic mail \(e-mail\);** 

**3. Facsimile, including e-fax services;**

**Page 50 January 24, 2019** 

**4. The internet, including the world wide web, file transfer protocols \(“FTP"\),  remote host access, etc.;** 

**5. Video teleconferencing; and** 

**6. Social media sites, internet relay chat \("IRC"\), instant messaging, bulletin boards,  and similar news or discussion groups.** 

**Before using one of the electronic communications enumerated above, Supervised  Persons must make sure they are authorized to do so. Certain electronic  communications, such as social media, are subject to stringent pre-approval  requirements set forth elsewhere in this manual. The Firm’s decision to approve one  Supervised Person to use a specific form of electronic communication does not imply  that the Firm has broadly approved the use of that form of electronic communication by  all Supervised Persons.** 

**16.1 Electronic Communications Policy** 

**The following summarizes the key points of the Firm's electronic communications policy:** 

**• The Firm's electronic communications systems are to be used for business  purposes only.** 

**• Without the prior approval of the Designated Principal, electronic  communications with clients, regulators, or the public concerning the Firm’s  business are permitted only on Firm-approved communications systems.** 

**• Electronic communications are not private and may be monitored, reviewed, and  archived by the Firm.** 

**• No Supervised Person, other than specifically authorized personnel, is permitted  to post anything on a website or social media site established by the Firm.** 

**• Without the prior approval of the Designated Principal, no Supervised Person  may post any information concerning the Firm, its business, or clients to the  internet \(or similar third-party system\), containing references to the Firm,  communications involving investment advice, references to investment-related  issues, or information or links to any of the foregoing items.** 

**16.2 Review of Electronic Communications** 

**The Designated Principal will review the Firm’s use of electronic communications at  regular and frequent intervals to ensure the following:** 

**• Notice – Electronic notifications to customers are sent in a timely manner and  are adequate to properly convey the message.**

**Page 51 January 24, 2019** 

**• Access – Clients who are provided with information electronically are given  access to the same information as would be available to them in paper form.** 

**• Evidence of Delivery – The Firm’s procedures ensure that delivery obligations  are met when using electronic mail, which includes obtaining the client’s  informed consent and maintaining evidence of delivery.** 

**• Security – Reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure the integrity,  confidentiality, and security of information sent through electronic means; and  that such precautions have been tailored to the medium used.** 

**• Consent – Prior to sending personal financial information electronically, the Firm  has obtained the informed consent of the recipient \(unless the client gives  implicit consent by, for example, sending an email to the Firm requesting the  financial information\).** 

**16.3 Advertising and Sales Literature** 

**Advertisements or marketing materials sent through electronic media will be subject to  the same requirements as if they were made in paper form.** 

**16.4 Disclosure Information** 

**Disclosures delivered by electronic communication are subject to the same policies,  procedures, and content standards governing disclosure information delivered in paper  format. The Firm will ensure that evidence of delivery of disclosure information sent  through an electronic communication is obtained and preserved in accordance with  applicable record retention requirements.** 

**16.5 Standards for Electronic Communications** 

**16.5.1 Lack of Privacy and Reliability** 

**Electronic communications may be widely disseminated. Therefore, electronic  communications may be unsuitable for communications that must remain confidential  or private. Absent encryption or other safeguards, it is best to avoid sending electronic  communications containing sensitive information to external parties. There should be  no expectation of privacy in electronic communications. Due to the nature of electronic  communications systems, there is no guarantee that a message or other electronic  communication will reach its destination in a timely manner \(or that it will reach its  destination at all\) without being viewed by other parties.**

**Page 52 January 24, 2019** 

**16.5.2 Guidelines for Electronic Communications** 

**Users of the Firm’s electronic communications systems are expected to follow  appropriate business communication standards. Usage must comply with all applicable  international, federal, state, and local laws. The following guidelines apply:** 

**• Electronic communications to clients should contain the most recent, valid  information available.** 

**• The unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information is prohibited.** 

**• The unauthorized copying or transmittal of software or other materials  protected by copyright law is prohibited.** 

**• Electronic communications systems not approved or sponsored by the Firm  should not be used for the Firm’s business without the prior approval of the  Designated Principal.** 

**• Access to each employee's computer, telephone, and other electronic  communications systems should be reasonably safeguarded. Passwords should  be kept in a secure location.** 

**• The use of encryption technologies is encouraged when delivering sensitive  information. However, encryption technologies must be approved by the  Designated Principal. Supervised Persons are prohibited from encrypting  communications with the intent to evade supervisory review.** 

**• Personnel must preserve electronic communications sent and received according  to regulatory requirements and the Firm’s policies and procedures. The Firm’s  requirements for retaining electronic communications may be greater than  those that apply to other written communications.** 

**• Communications with the public may require pre-approval in accordance with  other policies and procedures set forth in this manual. If in doubt, the Supervised  Person is responsible for checking with the Designated Principal before  disseminating information via electronic or conventional means.** 

**• Electronic communications through the Firm’s systems are the property of the  Firm. The Firm reserves the right to monitor, audit, record, and retain electronic  communications for the purpose of complying with applicable laws and  regulations.** 

**16.6 Maintenance of Electronic Communications** 

**Electronic communications will be archived and preserved for recordkeeping purposes  as required by applicable laws and regulations.**

**Page 53 January 24, 2019** 

**16.7 Licensing Requirements** 

**Care must be taken to ensure that electronic communications directed to a person in a  particular state comply with the securities laws and rules of that state, including without  limitation, requirements that the Firm or the Advisory Representative be registered in  that state or qualify for an exemption or exclusion from the registration requirement.  Advisory Representatives are prohibited from using electronic communications to effect  securities transactions or render investment advisory services for compensation in any  state in which the Firm or the Advisory Representative is not properly registered.** 

**16.8 Inadvertent Receipt or Delivery of Electronic  Communications through Unapproved Means** 

**From time to time, an Advisory Representative may inadvertently send or receive a  business-related communication through an unapproved means of communication. For  example, a client might send an email to an Advisory Representative’s personal email  address or the client might attempt to communicate with the Advisory Representative  through social media. The Firm recognizes that these types of communications are  usually the result of the client’s lack of understanding regarding the strict rules and  regulations governing the Firm’s communications. Consequently, the Firm will not cite  an Advisory Representative for these inadvertent violations of the Firm’s policies and  procedures so long as he takes reasonable measures to ensure that future  communications are made through approved means, which is usually accomplished by  providing instructions to the client on the proper way to communicate business-related  information.**  

**If possible, the Advisory Representative should capture the inadvertent communication  for the Firm’s records. In the case of an email communication sent to a personal  account, the Advisory Representative should forward the email received at his personal  account to his Firm-approved email address. In the case of a communication sent to a  personal social media account, it is recommended that the Advisory Representative try  to print a screenshot of the communication for the Firm’s records. In all cases involving  the inadvertent receipt or delivery of communications through unapproved means, the  Advisory Representative should make the Designated Principal or other supervisory  personnel aware of the occurrence and how it was resolved.** 

**16.9 Social Media** 

**Any website or webpage that allows for interactive electronic communications is  considered social media, regardless of whether such website is known as a social media  or social networking site. Websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter are clearly social** 

**Page 54 January 24, 2019** 

**media sites. However, other websites that are not typically considered social media may  have components that are social media. For example, a website that has a chat forum  would be deemed social media. Even a news website could be deemed social media if it  allows readers to post comments about articles or otherwise communicate with other  readers or the public.**  

**16.9.1 Social Media Policy** 

**Supervised Persons are prohibited from using social media to conduct business unless  they obtain the prior written approval of the Designated Principal. Supervised Persons  wishing to utilize social media in any way for business purposes should submit a written  request to the Designated Principal. The Designated Principal will formally approve or  deny the request in writing. The Firm will not approve any form of social media that it  cannot reasonably supervise.**  

**16.9.2 Recordkeeping** 

**The Firm must maintain records of communications made through social media. Due to  the technical difficulty of enforcing this requirement, the Firm will not approve the use  of social media unless it has a means to capture records of communications. The  approval of social media will generally necessitate the use of a third party vendor to  archive electronic communications.** 

**16.9.3 Recommendations and Investment Advice** 

**Advisory Representatives may not use social media for making investment  recommendations or otherwise rendering investment advice unless the Designated  Principal has previously approved both the content of the communication and the  Advisory Representative’s use of social media.**  

**16.9.4 Static and Interactive Electronic Forums** 

**A “blog” is generally defined as a website that contains an online personal journal with  reflections, comments, and often hyperlinks provided by the writer. Historically, some  blogs have consisted of static content posted by the blogger. Regulators consider static**  

**postings to constitute “advertisements.” If a Supervised Person wishes to sponsor a blog  or similar website, he must obtain prior principal approval of every posting. Many blogs  now enable users to engage in real-time interactive communications. If the blog were  used to engage in real-time interactive communications, regulators would consider the  blog to be an interactive electronic forum.** 

**Social networking sites typically contain both static and interactive content. The static  content remains posted until it is changed by the Firm or the individual who established  the account on the site. Generally, static content is accessible to all visitors to the site.** 

**Page 55 January 24, 2019** 

**Examples of static content typically available through social media sites include profile,  background, or wall information. The Designated Principal must approve all static  content on a page of a social media site established by the Firm or Supervised Person  before it is posted.** 

**Social media sites also contain non-static, real-time communications, such as interactive  posts on sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The portion of a social media site that  provides for these interactive communications constitutes an interactive electronic forum. The Firm will supervise the use of an approved interactive electronic forum in a  manner reasonably designed to ensure that its Supervised Persons do not violate  applicable regulatory requirements.** 

**16.9.5 Third-Party Posts** 

**If the Firm’s client or other third party posts content on a social media site established  by the Firm or its personnel, regulators generally will not treat posts by clients or other  third parties as the Firm’s communications. Thus, the prior principal approval, content,  and filing requirement generally do not apply to these third-party posts. Under certain**  

**circumstances, however, third-party posts may become attributable to the Firm.  Whether third-party content is attributable to the Firm will depend on whether the Firm  has \(1\) involved itself in the preparation of the content or \(2\) explicitly or implicitly  endorsed or approved the content.** 

**The SEC has referred to the circumstance in \(1\) above as the “entanglement” theory  \(i.e., the Firm or its personnel is entangled with the preparation of the third-party post\)  and in \(2\) as the “adoption” theory \(i.e., the Firm or its personnel has adopted its  content\). Although the SEC has employed these theories as a basis for a company’s  responsibility for third-party information that is hyperlinked to its website, a similar  analysis would apply to third-party posts on a social media site established by the Firm  or its personnel. Regulators would not consider a third-party post to be the Firm’s  communication unless the Firm or its personnel either is entangled with the preparation  of the third-party post or has adopted its content.**  

**16.9.6 Testimonials** 

**Supervised Persons are prohibited from inducing others to post content on a website,  especially testimonials or recommendations. Moreover, Supervised Persons who are  permitted to use social media may not display any testimonial or recommendation,  regardless of whether or not the Supervised Person requested the testimonial or  recommendation.**

**Page 56 January 24, 2019** 

**16.9.7 Supervision of Social Media** 

**The Firm will adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its  Supervised Persons who use social media for business purposes are appropriately  supervised, have the necessary training and background to engage in such activities, and  do not present undue risks to investors. The Firm’s general policy prohibits any  Supervised Person from engaging in business communications in a social media site  without obtaining prior written approval. Supervised Persons approved to use social  media will receive adequate training on the Firm’s policies and procedures regarding  interactive electronic communications before engaging in such communications. The  training will generally be individualized based on the type of social media approved.** 

**The Firm will employ risk-based principles to determine the extent to which the review  of incoming, outgoing, and internal electronic communications is necessary for the  proper supervision of business. For example, the Firm may adopt procedures that  require principal review of some or all interactive electronic communications prior to  use or may adopt various methods of post-use review, including sampling and lexicon based search methodologies. The Designated Principal will determine the type of review  based on his or her assessment of risk. The Firm may consider strictly prohibiting or  placing severe restrictions on any Supervised Person who has presented compliance  risks in the past, particularly compliance risks concerning sales practices, from  establishing accounts with a social media site.** 

| **17. PRIVACY POLICY** |
| :--- |


**Neither the Firm nor any of its Supervised Persons may share nonpublic personal  information of consumers with nonaffiliated third parties, except as required in order to  provide the services offered. Client information will be safeguarded by restricting access  to the information to only those employees who need access in order to service the  client’s account. The Designated Principal is responsible for ensuring that security  controls are adequate to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing information.**  

**Hard copy documents should be secured by locking the file cabinet or office in which  they are stored. Information kept on the Firm’s computers should be password protected and secured behind firewalls. A paper shredder is to be used for destruction  of all client-related documents that are not required to be retained by the Firm. All  Supervised Persons will participate in new hire training, and additional training at least  once annually thereafter.** 

**Page 57 January 24, 2019** 

**17.1 Privacy Notices** 

**The Firm must provide new clients with an initial privacy notice and annual privacy  notices thereafter. The Designated Principal is responsible for compliance with  Regulation S-P, including the following:** 

**• Providing an initial notice to each client;** 

**• Sending an annual notice to clients \(excluding certain institutional investors\) for  as long as the relationship continues;** 

**• Safeguarding customer records and information; and** 

**• Including all of the required disclosures and information in all notices to clients. 17.2 Reporting Privacy Violations** 

**If at any time a Supervised Person suspects the misuse or mishandling of confidential  information or identity theft, he must immediately notify the Designated Principal. As  required or deemed appropriate, the Designated Principal will promptly report any  suspected identity theft to the SEC and Federal Trade Commission and retain copies for  the files. The CCO is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with Regulation S-P.** 

**17.3 Breach Notification Laws** 

**Many states have laws that require notification to persons affected by data breaches. In  the event of a breach involving client or investor information, the Designated Principal  will ensure that the Firm complies with applicable state laws.** 

**17.4 Testing** 

**The Firm will perform reasonable testing of its information safeguards at least annually.  Additionally, the Firm will perform testing of any new technologies to assess whether  they pose any risks to clients’ information and privacy. The Designated Principal is  responsible for overseeing such testing functions and ensuring that they are adequate.**  

| **18. BUSINESS CONTINUITY** |
| :--- |


**The SEC believes and it is generally accepted that an investment adviser's fiduciary duty  to its clients includes the obligation to take steps to protect the clients' interests from  being placed at risk as a result of the investment adviser's inability to provide advisory  services after, for example, a natural disaster or, in the case of some smaller firms, the  death of the owner or key personnel.** 

**Page 58 January 24, 2019** 

**18.1 Business Continuity Plan** 

**The Firm maintains a business continuity plan \(“BCP”\) as a separate document.**  

**18.2 Business Continuity Testing** 

**At least annually, the Firm will review the adequacy of it BCP. This review should cover  data backup capabilities, data recovery, remote access capabilities, response and  recovery times, and other applicable areas. The Designated Principal should document  the results of the review and integrate any needed updates into the Firm’s BCP.**  

**18.3 Succession Planning** 

**Certain states currently require or have proposed requiring investment advisers to have  a succession plan. If required by a state or reasonably necessary to protect the interest  of clients and investors, the Designated Principal will establish and maintain a  succession plan for the Firm.** 

| **19. INSIDER TRADING** |
| :--- |


**The Firm is required to establish, maintain, and enforce supervisory procedures that are  reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of non-public information. All Supervised  Persons are strictly prohibited from trading on any information that could be construed  as material, non-public information as well as disclosing such information to others.  Such trading activity may not occur in any account that is controlled directly or indirectly  by the Supervised Person.** 

**19.1 Definitions** 

**The definition of insider trading has evolved through case law and administrative  proceedings, and has included:** 

**• Buying or selling securities on the basis of material non-public information. This  would include \(1\) purchasing or selling for the employee's own account or one  which the employee has a financial interest or \(2\) for the Firm's proprietary  trading or investment account. If any employee is uncertain as to whether  information is "material" or "non-public," the Designated Principal should be  immediately consulted.** 

**• Disclosing insider information to inappropriate personnel, whether for  consideration or not \(i.e., tipping\). Insider information must be disseminated on  a "need to know" basis only to appropriate personnel. Again, a Designated  Principal should be consulted if any questions arise.**

**Page 59 January 24, 2019** 

**19.1.1 Material Information** 

**Material information is information that an investor would most likely consider  important in making his investment decisions, or information that is reasonably certain  to have a substantial effect on the price of a company’s securities, regardless of whether  the information is related directly to the company’s business.** 

**19.1.2 Non-Public Information** 

**Non-public information is information that has not been communicated to the public.** 

**19.2 Personnel to Whom Insider Trading Policies Apply** 

**All employees and Supervised Persons of the Firm are subject to the insider trading  policies contained within this section. An employee is defined as any person who is  associated with and performs any duties on behalf of the Firm.** 

**19.3 Purpose of Insider Trading Policy** 

**The Firm’s policies, procedures, and training program are designed to do the following: • Identify personnel to whom the Firm's insider trading policies apply; • Educate employees on what constitutes insider trading;** 

**• Provide communication of insider trading policies to the Firm's employees; • Establish a "Chinese wall" when and where applicable;** 

**• Identify the responsibilities of the Firm's employees and supervisors; • Define sanctions for non-compliance with the Insider Trading Act; and • Provide an overview of the Firm's current business.** 

**19.4 Insider Trading Policy** 

**The Firm’s policy prohibits Supervised Persons from effecting securities transactions  while in the possession of material, non-public information. Supervised Persons are also  prohibited from disclosing such information to others. The prohibition against insider  trading applies not only to the security to which the inside information directly relates,  but also to related securities such as options or convertible securities.** 

**If any Supervised Person receives inside information, he must immediately notify only  the Compliance Department and/or a member of senior management. When in  possession of inside information, Supervised Persons are prohibited from trading on  that information, whether for the account of the Firm or any customer, their own  account, any accounts in which they have direct or indirect beneficial interest \(including** 

**Page 60 January 24, 2019** 

**accounts for family members\), or any other account over which they have control,  discretionary authority, or power of attorney.** 

**19.5 Responsibilities** 

**All Supervised Persons must make a diligent effort to ensure that a violation of the  Insider Trading Act does not occur either intentionally or inadvertently. In this regard,  the Supervised Person is responsible for:** 

**• Reading, understanding, and consenting to comply with the insider trading  policy. Employees will be requested to sign and acknowledge that they have read  and understood their responsibilities.** 

**• Ensuring that no trading occurs in his account or any account in which he has a  beneficial interest involving securities for which he has insider information.** 

**• Not disclosing any insider information obtained from any source whatsoever to  inappropriate persons. Disclosure to family, friends, or acquaintances can be  grounds for immediate termination.** 

**• Consulting the CCO or Designated Principal when questions may arise regarding  insider trading or when a potential insider trading violation is suspected.** 

**• Ensuring that the Firm is receiving copies of immediate family's \(including spouse  and any relative living in the same household\) confirmations and statements  from brokerage firms, or that the Firm has an alternative means to monitor  trading in the accounts of immediate family.** 

**• Advising the Firm of all outside activities, directorships, or major ownership in a  public company over 5%. No employee may engage in any outside activities as  employee, proprietor, partner, consultant, trustee officer, or director without  prior written approval from the Compliance Department.** 

**If an employee is in a position within the Firm to access inside information, the following  are steps the employee must take to preserve the confidentiality of inside information:**  

**• Material inside information should be communicated only when there exists a  justifiable reason to do so on a "need to know" basis inside or outside the Firm.**  

**• Employees should not discuss confidential matters in elevators, hallways,  restaurants, airplanes, taxicabs, or any place where they can be overheard.**  

**• Employees should not leave sensitive memoranda on their desks or in other  places where others can read them.** 

**• Employees should not leave a computer terminal without exiting the file in which  they were working.** 

**Page 61 January 24, 2019** 

**• Employees should not read confidential documents in public places or discard  them where others can retrieve them. Employees should avoid carrying  confidential documents in an exposed manner.**  

**• In drafts of sensitive documents, employees should use code names or delete  names to avoid the identification of participants.**  

**• Employees should not discuss confidential business information with spouses,  relatives, or friends.**  

**• Employees should avoid even the appearance of impropriety.**  

**Serious repercussions may follow from insider trading, and the law proscribing insider  trading can change at any time. Since it is often difficult to determine what constitutes  insider trading, employees should consult the Compliance Department whenever they  have questions about this subject.** 

**19.6 Reporting Violations** 

**If any Supervised Person believes that he or someone else may have obtained or  disclosed inside or proprietary information in a manner not permitted by the Firm, the  Supervised Person should immediately contact the Designated Principal and refrain  from using or further disclosing such information. All employees are obligated to  immediately report any insider trading-related situations that they become aware of,  including any suspicions they may have of insider trading. Failure to report violations  can result in disciplinary action, including termination. Reports of violations will be  treated as highly confidential.** 

**19.7 Supervision** 

**The Designated Principal is responsible for implementing procedures to protect against  insider trading. The Designated Principal is also responsible for detecting and preventing  possible abuses based on the use of material non-public information in employee related accounts; family-related accounts; accounts controlled by employees; and all  accounts with the Firm. During the periodic review of accounts and the review and  approval of securities transactions, the Designated Principal should note any unusual  activity, such as short-term profits or profits taken before major news announcements.  Investigations of insider trading may include, among other things, interviewing the  Advisory Representative\(s\), reviewing transactions in the same security, looking to see if  any nominee accounts have been established, and reviewing outside brokerage  accounts.** 

**Page 62 January 24, 2019** 

**19.8 Training and Oversight** 

**The Designated Principal will consider providing upon hire and periodically throughout  the year educational material geared toward familiarizing all employees with insider  trading. The Designated Principal is responsible for detecting and preventing insider  trading abuses through measures that include:** 

**1. Creating and modifying the insider trading policies;** 

**2. Communicating the insider trading policies to newly hired employees and during  compliance meetings;** 

**3. Obtaining written acknowledgment and consent forms;** 

**4. Reviewing employee confirmations and statements for potential insider trading  violations and keeping evidence of the reviews;** 

**5. Answering questions from employees regarding insider trading; 6. Documenting any investigation of possible insider trading, noting: • Name of security** 

**• Date investigation commenced** 

**• Accounts reviewed** 

**• Summary of disposition** 

**7. Initiating disciplinary action against any employee violating the Insider Trading  Act or the Firm’s insider trading policy.** 

**19.9 Insider Trading Investigations** 

**The investigation of an employee transaction will be evaluated using reasonable criteria,  including consideration of the timing or unusual nature of the transaction. All  investigations initiated must be documented. At a minimum, the record will include:** 

**• The name of the security;** 

**• The date the investigation commenced;** 

**• An identification of the accounts involved; and** 

**• A summary of the investigation disposition.** 

**The Designated Principal should create a memorandum for every investigation and  attach any exhibits necessary to evidence a detailed investigation of the trading activity.  The Designated Principal should date and sign the memorandum to document the  investigation.**

**Page 63 January 24, 2019** 

**19.10 Disciplinary Actions** 

**Violations of the Insider Trading Act can result in severe penalties to the Firm, its  principals, and the individuals violating the rule. Violations \(whether inadvertent or  intentional\) will not be tolerated by the Firm and will result in severe disciplinary action.** 

| **20. RISK ASSESSMENT** |
| :--- |


**The Firm has developed a process for evaluating risk. The CCO is responsible for this  process and will ensure that the key areas of business risk are evaluated in relationship  to the Firm’s core business.**  

**A major component of the Firm’s risk assessment is the regular review of compliance  policies and procedures. During these reviews, the CCO will assess whether the Firm’s  policies and procedures are adequate to address risks and other concerns. The CCO  must review, at least once annually, the adequacy of the established compliance policies  and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation. With respect to risk  management, the review should consider, at a minimum, the following:** 

**• Any risks or other compliance matters that arose during the previous year;** 

**• Any changes in the business activities of the Firm or its affiliates that create  additional risk; and** 

**• Any changes in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or applicable regulations  that might suggest a need to revise the policies or procedures to better manage  risk.** 

**The CCO may choose to perform components of the review throughout the year in an  effort to minimize the burden on the Firm’s compliance personnel and resources.** 

**20.1 Risk Assessment Methods** 

**In addition to annually reviewing policies and procedures, the Firm may fulfill its duty to  evaluate risk through the use of risk assessment tools, such as an Excel spreadsheet  designed to identify areas of risk. The CCO may use any appropriate risk assessment  tool, including resources obtainable from its compliance consulting firm, to assess risks  of the Firm and the organization as a whole.**  

**20.2 Use of Others to Assess Risk** 

**It is often prudent to utilize the services of risk management and compliance  professionals to assess risk from an outsider’s perspective. Although highly competent** 

**Page 64 January 24, 2019** 

**in the area of risk management, the CCO may invite compliance consultants or other  professionals to participate in the Firm’s risk assessments.**  

| **21. EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT INCOME AND SECURITY  ACT \(ERISA\)** |
| :--- |


**The Employee Retirement Income and Security Act \(“ERISA”\) contains a number of  provisions affecting investment advisers engaged in managing or other advisory  activities with respect to ERISA accounts. ERISA rules and regulations are quite complex  and in cases of uncertainty the Firm should seek expert advice before engaging in  business dealings or signing contracts. Complex issues are best addressed by consulting  knowledgeable professionals. As of the date of this manual, the Firm does not advise  ERISA accounts or plans.** 

| **22. PROXY VOTING** |
| :--- |


**If an investment adviser exercises voting authority with respect to client securities, Rule  206\(4\)-6 requires the investment adviser to adopt and implement written policies and  procedures reasonably designed to ensure that client securities are voted in the best  interest of the client. This requirement is consistent with legal interpretations which  hold that an investment adviser’s fiduciary duty includes handling the voting of proxies  on securities held in client accounts over which the investment adviser exercises  investment or voting discretion, in a manner consistent with the best interest of the  client.** 

**• The Firm adopts and implements written policies and procedures that are  reasonably designed to ensure that it votes client securities in the best interest  of clients. At a minimum, these procedures must include how the Firm addresses  material conflicts that may arise between its interests and those of its clients.** 

**• The Firm discloses to clients how they may obtain information about how it  voted with respect to their securities.**  

**• The Firm describes to clients the Firm’s proxy voting policies and procedures  and, upon request, furnishes a copy of the policies and procedures to the  requesting client.** 

**22.1 Proxy Voting Requirements** 

**Neither the Firm nor its Advisory Representatives may exercise voting authority with  respect to client securities unless the Firm complies with these requirements:**

**Page 65 January 24, 2019** 

**• The Firm adopts and implements written policies and procedures that are  reasonably designed to ensure that it votes client securities in the best interest  of clients. At a minimum, these procedures must include how the Firm addresses  material conflicts that may arise between its interests and those of its clients.** 

**• The Firm discloses to clients how they may obtain information about how it  voted with respect to their securities.**  

**• The Firm describes to clients the Firm’s proxy voting policies and procedures  and, upon request, furnishes a copy of the policies and procedures to the  requesting client.** 

**22.2 Proxy Voting Policy** 

**The Firm does not currently vote proxies for its clients.**  

| **23. BOOKS AND RECORDS** |
| :--- |


**The Designated Principal is responsible for enforcing all books and records requirements  and ensuring that all documents are properly maintained in accordance with Rule 204-2.  Supervised Persons must take great care to maintain required books and records.  Moreover, Supervised Persons must exercise extreme caution to ensure that they do  not inadvertently destroy any records that are required to be maintained by the Firm.** 

**23.1 Required Records** 

**SEC Rule 204-2 contains a long list of records that the Firm is required to keep true,  accurate, and current. The following documents are to be maintained by the Firm:**

**• show the terms and conditions of the order, instruction, modification, or  cancellation;**  

**• identify the person connected with the Firm who recommended the  transaction to the client and the person who placed such order; and** 

**Page 66 January 24, 2019** 

**• show the account for which entered, the date of entry, and the bank, broker,  or dealer by or through whom executed, where appropriate.**  

**Orders entered pursuant to the exercise of discretionary power shall be so  designated.**

**iii. the placing or execution of any order to purchase or sell any security:  Provided, however, \(a\) that the Firm will not be required to keep any  unsolicited marketing letters and other similar communications of  general public distribution not prepared by or for the Firm, and \(b\) that if  the Firm sends any notice, circular, or other advertisement offering any  report, analysis, publication, or other investment advisory service to  more than 10 persons, the Firm will not be required to keep a record of  the names and addresses of the persons to whom it was sent; except that  if such notice, circular, or advertisement is distributed to persons named  on any list, the Firm will retain with the copy of such notice, circular, or  advertisement, a memorandum describing the list and the source  thereof.** 

**8. A list or other record of all accounts in which the Firm is vested with any  discretionary power with respect to the funds, securities, or transactions of any client.**

**14. A copy of each written statement and each amendment or revision thereof,  given or sent to any client or prospective client of the Firm in accordance with  the provisions of Rule 204-3, and a record of the dates that each written  statement, and each amendment or revision thereof, was given, or offered to be  given, to any client or prospective client who subsequently becomes a client.**

**Page 68 January 24, 2019** 

**circulates or distributes, directly or indirectly, to 10 or more persons \(other than  persons connected with the Firm\); provided, however, that with respect to the  performance of managed accounts, the retention of all account statements, if  they reflect all debits, credits, and other transactions in a client's account for the  period of the statement, and all worksheets necessary to demonstrate the  calculation of the performance or rate of return of all managed accounts will be  deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.**
